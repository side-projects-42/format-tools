Internet Archive and Center for Open Science Collaborate to Preserve Open Science Data
======================================================================================

Posted on [September 24, 2019](http://blog.archive.org/2019/09/24/internet-archive-and-center-for-open-science-collaborate-to-preserve-open-science-data/ "3:56 pm")<span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="http://blog.archive.org/author/jefferson/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by jefferson">jefferson</a></span></span>

Open Science and research reproducibility rely on ongoing access to research data. With funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services’ [National Leadership Grants for Libraries](https://www.imls.gov/grants/available/national-leadership-grants-libraries) program, the Internet Archive (IA) and [Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/) (COS) will work together to ensure that open data related to the scientific research process is archived for perpetual access, redistribution, and reuse. The project aims to leverage the intersection between open research data, the long-term stewardship activities of libraries, and distributed data sharing and preservation networks. By focusing on these three areas of work, the project will test and implement infrastructure for improved data sharing in further support of open science and data curation. Building out interoperability between open data platforms like the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) (OSF) of COS, large scale digital archives like IA, and collaborative preservation networks has the potential to enable more seamless distribution of open research data and enable new forms of custody and use. See also the [press release from COS](https://cos.io/about/news/center-open-science-and-internet-archive-announce-collaboration-preserve-open-data/) announcing this project.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cos_logo.png" class="wp-image-18960" width="175" height="105" /></figure>OSF supports the research lifecycle by enabling researchers to produce and manage registrations and data artifacts for further curation to foster adoption and discovery. The Internet Archive works with 700+ institutions to collect, archive, and provide access to born-digital and web-published resources and data. Preservation at IA of open data on OSF will enable further availability of this data to other preservation networks and curatorial partners for distributed long term stewardship and local custody by research institutions using both COS and IA services. The project will also partner with a number of preservation networks and repositories to mirror portions of this data and test additional interoperability among additional stewardship organizations and digital preservation systems.

Beyond the prototyping and technical work of data archiving, the teams will also be conducting training, including the development of open education resources, webinars, and similar materials to ensure data librarians can incorporate the project deliverables into their local research data management workflows. The two-year project will first focus on [OSF Registrations](https://cos.io/our-products/osf-registries/) data and expand to include other open access materials hosted on OSF. Later stage work will test interoperable approaches to sharing subsets of this data with other preservation networks such as LOCKSS, AP Trust, and individual university libraries. Together, IA and COS aim to lay the groundwork for seamless technical integration supporting the full lifecycle of data publishing, distribution, preservation, and perpetual access.
