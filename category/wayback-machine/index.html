<p>In July, we announced our <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/07/28/archive-it-and-archives-unleashed-join-forces-to-scale-research-use-of-web-archives/">partnership with the Archives Unleashed</a> project as part of our ongoing effort to make new services available for scholars and students to study the archived web. Joining the curatorial power of our <a href="https://archive-it.org/">Archive-It</a> service, our work <a href="http://blog.archive.org/tag/web-data-research/">supporting text and data mining</a>, and <a href="https://archivesunleashed.org/">Archives Unleashed’s</a> in-browser analysis tools will open up new opportunities for understanding the petabyte-scale volume of historical records in web archives.</p>

<p>As part of our partnership, we are releasing a series of publicly available datasets created from archived web collections. Alongside these efforts, the project is also launching a Cohort Program providing funding and technical support for research teams interested in studying web archive collections. These twin efforts aim to help build the infrastructure and services to allow more researchers to leverage web archives in their scholarly work. More details on the new public datasets and the cohorts program are below. </p>
<p><strong>Early Web Datasets</strong></p>
<p>Our first in a series of public datasets from the web collections are oriented around the theme of the early web. These are, of course, datasets intended for data mining and researchers using computational tools to study large amounts of data, so are absent the informational or nostalgia value of looking at archived webpages in the Wayback Machine. If the latter is more your interest, here is an archived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040312165034/http://www.geocities.com/linda6619/caitlinsgraphics.html">Geocities page with unicorn GIFs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>GeoCities Collection (1994–2009)</strong></p>
<p>As one of the first platforms for creating web pages without expertise, Geocities lowered the barrier of entry for a new generation of website creators. There were at least 38 million pages displayed by GeoCities before it was terminated by Yahoo! in 2009. This dataset collection contains a number of individual datasets that include data such as domain counts, image graph and web graph data, and binary file information for a variety of file formats like audio, video, and text and image files. A graphml file is also available for the domain graph.</p>
<p>GeoCities Dataset Collection: <a href="https://archive.org/details/geocitiesdatasets" class="uri">https://archive.org/details/geocitiesdatasets</a></p>
<p><strong>Friendster (2003–2015)</strong></p>
<p>Friendster was an early and widely used social media networking site where users were able to establish and maintain layers of shared connections with other users. This dataset collection contains  graph files that allow data-driven research to explore how certain pages within Friendster linked to each other. It also contains a dataset that provides some basic metadata about the individual files within the archival collection. </p>

<p><strong>Early Web Language Datasets (1996–1999)</strong></p>
<p>These two related datasets were generated from the Internet Archive’s global web archive collection. The first dataset, “Parallel Language Records of the Early Web (1996–1999)” provides a dataset of multilingual records, or URLs of websites that have the same text represented in multiple languages. Such multi-language text from websites are a rich source for parallel language corpora and can be valuable in machine translation. The second dataset, “Language Annotations of the Early Web (1996–1999)” is another metadata set that annotates the language of over four million websites using Compact Language Detector (CLD3).</p>

<p><strong>Archives Unleashed Cohort Program</strong></p>
<p>Applications are now being accepted from research teams interested in performing computational analysis of web archive data. Five cohorts teams of up to five members each will be selected to participate in the program from July 2021 to June 2022. Teams will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participate in cohort events, training, and support, with a closing event held at Internet Archive, in San Francisco, California, USA tentatively in May 2022. Prior events will be virtual or in-person, depending on COVID-19 restrictions</li>
<li>Receive bi-monthly mentorship via support meetings with the Archives Unleashed team</li>
<li>Work in the Archive-It Research Cloud to generate custom datasets</li>
<li>Receive funding of $11,500 CAD to support project work. Additional support will be provided for travel to the Internet Archive event</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications are due March 31, 2021. Please visit the <a href="https://archivesunleashed.org/cohorts/">Archives Unleashed Research Cohorts webpage</a> for more details on the program and instructions on how to apply.</p>

<p>Looking for a research paper but can’t find a copy in your library’s catalog or popular search engines? Give <a href="https://scholar.archive.org">Internet Archive Scholar</a> a try! We might have a PDF from a “vanished” Open Access publisher in our web archive, an author’s pre-publication manuscript from their archived faculty webpage, or a digitized microfilm version of an older publication.</p>
<p>We hope Internet Archive Scholar will aid researchers and librarians looking for specific open access papers that may not be otherwise available to them. Judith van Stegeren (<span class="citation" data-cites="jd7g">[@jd7g]</span>(https://twitter.com/jd7h) on Twitter), a PhD candidate in the Netherlands, encountered just such a situation recently <a href="https://twitter.com/jd7h/status/1362413265213677570">when sharing a workshop paper</a> on procedural generation in computer games: “Towards Qualitative Procedural Generation” by Mark R. Johnson, originally presented at the Computational Creativity &amp; Games Workshop in 2016. The papers for this particular year of the workshop are not indexed in the usual bibliographic catalogs, and the original workshop website hosting the Open Access papers is no longer accessible. Fortunately, copies of all the 2016 workshop papers were captured in the Wayback Machine, and can be found today by <a href="https://scholar.archive.org/search?q=journal%3A%22Computational+Creativity+Games+Workshop%22">searching IA Scholar by title or conference name</a>.</p>
<p>As another example, dozens of papers from the <em>Open Journal of Hematology</em> are no longer resolvable via DOI. As mentioned in a <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/09/15/how-the-internet-archive-is-ensuring-permanent-access-to-open-access-journal-articles/">previous blog post</a>, the publisher’s website vanished and has been replaced with unrelated advertisements. But before that happened, the papers were captured in the Wayback Machine, <a href="https://fatcat.wiki/container/plhitgzuq5e6tmtd5ue4sff7ua">indexed in our catalog</a>, and can now be searched in full:</p>

IA Scholar Search Results
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>IA Scholar is a simple, access-oriented interface to content identified across several Internet Archive collections, including web archives, archive.org files, and digitized print materials. The full text of articles is searchable for users that are hunting for particular phrases or keywords. This complements our <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=&amp;sin=TXT">existing full-text search index</a> of millions of digitized books and other documents on archive.org.</p>
<p>The service builds on <a href="https://fatcat.wiki/">Fatcat</a>, an open catalog we have developed to identify at-risk and web-published open scholarly outputs that can benefit from long-term preservation, additional metadata, and perpetual access. Fatcat includes resources that may be useful to librarians and archivists, such as bulk metadata dumps, a read/write API, command-line tool, and file-level archival metadata. If you are interested in collaborating with us, or are a researcher interested in text analysis applications, we have a <a href="https://gitter.im/internetarchive/fatcat">public chat channel</a> or can be contacted by email at info@archive.org.</p>
<p>IA Scholar marks a milestone in our work initiated in 2018 to leverage the automation and scale of web and API harvesting in providing open infrastructure for the preservation of and perpetual access to scholarly materials from the public web. We particularly want to thank the Mellon Foundation for <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2018/03/05/andrew-w-mellon-foundation-awards-grant-to-the-internet-archive-for-long-tail-journal-preservation/">their original and ongoing support of this work,</a> our many current partners, and the other collaborators, contributors, and volunteers.</p>
<p>All of this is possible because of the incredible open research ecosystem built and collectively maintained by Open Access advocates. Thank you to the <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/11/05/internet-archive-participates-in-doaj-led-collaboration-to-improve-the-preservation-of-oa-journals/">DOAJ and other groups</a> for helping catalog open access journals which has aided preservation. Thank you to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/biodiversity">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a> and its supporters for digitizing print journal literature. And thank you to the many other organizations we have worked with, integrated, or whose services we have utilized, including open web indices (<a href="http://unpaywall.org/">Unpaywall</a>, <a href="https://core.ac.uk/">CORE</a>, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/">CiteseerX</a>, <a href="https://academic.microsoft.com/home">Microsoft Academic</a>, <a href="http://semanticscholar.org">Semantic Scholar</a>), directories of open journals (<a href="https://doaj.org/">DOAJ</a>, <a href="https://road.issn.org/">ROAD</a> <a href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/about.html">SHERPA/ROMEO</a>, <a href="https://jurnsearch.wordpress.com/directory/">JURN</a>, <a href="http://wikidata.org">Wikidata</a>), and open bibliographic catalogs (<a href="http://crossref.org">Crossref</a>, <a href="https://datacite.org/">Datacite</a>, <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/">J-STAGE</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.gov/">Pubmed</a>, <a href="https://dblp.org/">dblp</a>). </p>
<p>IA Scholar is built from open source software components, and is itself <a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/fatcat-scholar">released as Free Software</a>. The website has been <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/internetarchive/">translated into eight languages (so far!)</a> by generous volunteers.</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/09/15/how-the-internet-archive-is-ensuring-permanent-access-to-open-access-journal-articles/" title="5:35 pm">September 15, 2020</a><span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/bnewbold/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by bnewbold">bnewbold</a></span></span></p>
<p><em>Internet Archive has archived and identified 9 million open access journal articles– the next 5 million is getting harder</em></p>
<p>Open Access journals, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190520161038/http:/newtheologyreview.org:80/index.php/ntr/issue/archive">New Theology Review</a> (ISSN: 0896-4297) and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190621023739/http://rossscience.org/ojhmt/index.php">Open Journal of Hematology</a> (ISSN: 2075-907X), made their research articles available for free online for years. With a quick click or a simple query, students anywhere in the world could access their articles, and diligent Wikipedia editors could verify facts against original articles on vitamin deficiency and blood donation.  </p>
<p>But some journals, such as these titles, are no longer available from the publisher’s websites, and are only available through the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Since 2017, the Internet Archive joined others in concentrating on archiving all scholarly literature and making it permanently accessible.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web has made it easier than ever for scholars to collaborate, debate, and share their research. Unfortunately, the structure of today’s web means that content can disappear just as easily: as of today the official publisher websites and DOI redirects for both of the above journals go nowhere or have been replaced with unrelated content.</p>

<p>Vigilant librarians saw this problem coming decades ago, when the print-to-digital migration was getting started. They insisted that commercial publishers work with contract digital preservation organizations (such as Portico, LOCKSS, and CLOCKSS) to ensure long-term access to expensive journal subscription content. Efforts have been made to preserve open articles as well, such as Public Knowledge Project’s <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-pn/">Private LOCKSS Network</a> for OJS journals and national hosting platforms like the <a href="https://www.scielo.br/">SciELO</a> network. But a portion of all scholarly articles continues to fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>Researchers found that 176 open access journals have already vanished from their publishers’ website over the past two decades, according to a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11933">preprint article</a> by Mikael Laakso, Lisa Matthias, and Najko Jahn. These periodicals were from all regions of the world and represented all major disciplines — sciences, humanities and social sciences. There are over 14,000 open access journals indexed by the <a href="https://doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> and the paper suggests another 900 of those are inactive and at risk of disappearing. The pre-print has struck a nerve, receiving news coverage in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-02610-z">Nature</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abe6998">Science</a>.</p>
<p>In 2017, with <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2018/03/05/andrew-w-mellon-foundation-awards-grant-to-the-internet-archive-for-long-tail-journal-preservation/">funding support from the Andrew Mellon Foundation</a> and the Kahle/Austin Foundation, the Internet Archive launched a project focused on preserving all publicly accessible research documents, with a particular focus on open access materials. Our first job was to quantify the scale of the problem.</p>

</figure>
<p>Of the 14.8 million known open access articles published since 1996, the Internet Archive has archived, identified, and made available through the Wayback Machine 9.1 million of them (“bright” green in the chart above). In the jargon of Open Access, we are counting only “gold” and “hybrid” articles which we expect to be available directly from the publisher, as opposed to preprints, such as in <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arxiv.org</a> or institutional repositories. Another 3.2 million are believed to be preserved by one or more contracted preservation organizations, based on records kept by <a href="https://keepers.issn.org/stats">Keepers Registry</a> (“dark” olive in the chart). These copies are not intended to be accessible to anybody unless the publisher becomes inaccessible, in which case they are “triggered” and become accessible.</p>
<p>This leaves at least 2.4 million Open Access articles at risk of vanishing from the web (“None”, red in the chart). While many of these are still on publisher’s websites, these have proven difficult to archive.</p>
<p>One of our goals is to archive as many of the articles on the open web as we can, and to keep up with the growing stream of new articles published every day. Another is to look back over the vast petabytes of web content in the Wayback Machine, back to 1996, and find any content we might already have but is not easily findable or discoverable. Both of these projects are amenable to software automation, but made more difficult by the evolving nature of HTML and PDFs and their diverse character sets and encodings. To that end, we have approached this project not just as a technical one, but also as a collaborative one that aims to add another piece to the distributed infrastructure supporting open scholarship.</p>
<p>To expand our reach, we built an editable catalog (<a href="https://fatcat.wiki" class="uri">https://fatcat.wiki</a>) with an open API to allow anybody to contribute. As the software is free and open source, as is the data, we invite others to reuse and link to the content we have archived. We have also <a href="https://scholar-qa.archive.org/">indexed and made searchable</a> much of the literature to help manage our work and help others find if we have archived particular articles. We want to make scholarly material permanently available, and available in new ways– including via large datasets for analysis and “meta research.” </p>
<p>We also want to acknowledge the many partnerships and collaborations that have supported this work, many of which are key parts of the open scholarly infrastructure, including ISSN, DOAJ, LOCKSS, Unpaywall, Semantic Scholar, CiteSeerX, Crossref, Datacite, and many others. We also want to acknowledge the many Internet Archive staff and volunteers that have contributed to this work, including Bryan Newbold, Martin Czygan, Paul Baclace, Jefferson Bailey, Kenji Nagahashi, David Rosenthal, Victoria Reich, Ellen Spertus, and others.</p>

<p>Archived web data and collections are increasingly important to scholarly practice, especially to those scholars interested in data mining and computational approaches to analyzing large sets of data, text, and records from the web. For over a decade Internet Archive has worked to support computational use of its web collections through a variety of services, from making <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2012/10/26/80-terabytes-of-archived-web-crawl-data-available-for-research/">raw crawl data available</a> to researchers, performing customized <a href="http://blog.archive.org/tag/web-data-research/">extraction and analytic services supporting network or language analysis</a>, to <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2017/01/02/join-us-for-a-white-house-social-media-and-gov-data-hackathon/">hosting</a> web data <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2016/08/31/hacking-web-archives/">hackathons</a> and having <a href="https://support.archive-it.org/hc/en-us/articles/209671666-Introduction-to-Archive-It-Research-Services-ARS-">dataset download features</a> in our popular suite of web archiving services in <a href="https://archive-it.org/">Archive-It</a>. Since 2016, we have also collaborated with the <a href="https://archivesunleashed.org/">Archives Unleashed</a> project to support their efforts to build tools, platforms, and learning materials for social science and humanities scholars to study web collections, including those curated by the <a href="https://archive-it.org/explore?show=Organizations">700+ institutions using Archive-It</a>. </p>

<p>We are excited to announce a significant expansion of our partnership. With a generous award of $800,000 (USD) to the University of Waterloo from The <a href="https://mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>, Archives Unleashed and Archive-It will broaden our collaboration and further integrate our services to provide easy-to-use, scalable tools to scholars, researchers, librarians, and archivists studying and stewarding web archives.  Further integration of Archives Unleashed and Archive-It’s Research Services (and IA’s Web &amp; Data Services more broadly) will simplify the ability of scholars to analyze archived web data and give digital archivists and librarians expanded tools for making their collections available as data, as pre-packaged datasets, and as archives that can be analyzed computationally. It will also offer researchers a best-of-class, end-to-end service for collecting, preserving, and analyzing web-published materials.</p>
<p>The Archives Unleashed team brings together a team of co-investigators.  Professor Ian Milligan, from the University of Waterloo’s Department of History, Jimmy Lin, Professor and Cheriton Chair at Waterloo’s Cheriton School of Computer Science, and Nick Ruest, Digital Assets Librarian in the Digital Scholarship Infrastructure department of York University Libraries, along with Jefferson Bailey, Director of Web Archiving &amp; Data Services at the Internet Archive, will all serve as co-Principal Investigators on the “Integrating Archives Unleashed Cloud with Archive-It” project. This project represents a follow-on to the Archives Unleashed project that began in 2017, also <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/news/multidisciplinary-project-will-help-historians-unlock">funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>“Our first stage of the Archives Unleashed Project,” explains Professor Milligan, “built a stand-alone service that turns web archive data into a format that scholars could easily use. We developed several tools, methods and cloud-based platforms that allow researchers to download a large web archive from which they can analyze all sorts of information, from text and network data to statistical information. The next logical step is to integrate our service with the Internet Archive, which will allow a scholar to run the full cycle of collecting and analyzing web archival content through one portal.”</p>
<p>“Researchers, from both the sciences and the humanities, are finally starting to realize the massive trove of archived web materials that can support a wide variety of computational research,” said Bailey. “We are excited to scale up our collaboration with Archives Unleashed to make the petabytes of web and data archives collected by Archive-It partners and other web archiving institutions around the world more useful for scholarly analysis.” </p>
<p>The project begins in July 2020 and will begin releasing public datasets as part of the integration later in the year. Upcoming and future work includes technical integration of Archives Unleashed and Archive-It, creation and release of new open-source tools, datasets, and code notebooks, and a series of in-person “datathons” supporting a cohort of scholars using archived web data and collections in their data-driven research and analysis. We are grateful to The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for their support of this integration and collaboration in support of critical infrastructure supporting computational scholarship and its use of the archived web.</p>

<p>The Internet Archive’s <a href="https://archive-it.org/">Archive-It</a> service is collaborating with the <a href="http://netpreserve.org/">International Internet Preservation Consortium’s</a> (IIPC) <a href="http://netpreserve.org/about-us/working-groups/content-development-working-group/">Content Development Group</a> (CDG) to archive web-published resources related to the ongoing Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. The IIPC Content Development Group consists of curators and professionals from dozens of libraries and archives from around the world that are preserving and providing access to the archived web. The Internet Archive is a co-founder and longtime member of the IIPC. The project will include both subject-expert curation by IIPC members as well as the inclusion of websites nominated by the public (see the nomination form link below).</p>
<p>Due to the urgency of the outbreak, archiving of nominated web content will commence immediately and continue as needed depending on the course of the outbreak and its containment. Web content from all countries and in any language is in scope. Possible topics to guide nominations and collections: </p>
<ul>
<li>Coronavirus origins </li>
<li>Information about the spread of infection </li>
<li>Regional or local containment efforts</li>
<li>Medical/Scientific aspects</li>
<li>Social aspects</li>
<li>Economic aspects</li>
<li>Political aspects</li>
</ul>
<p>Members of the general public are welcomed to nominate websites and web-published materials using the following web form: <a href="https://forms.gle/iAdvSyh6hyvv1wvx9" class="uri">https://forms.gle/iAdvSyh6hyvv1wvx9</a>. Archived information will also be available soon via the IIPC’s <a href="https://archive-it.org/home/IIPC">public collections in Archive-It</a>. [March 23, 2020 edit: the public collection can now be found here, <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/13529" class="uri">https://archive-it.org/collections/13529</a>.]</p>
<p>Members of the general public can also take advantage of the ability to upload non-web digital resources directly to specific Internet Archive collections such as <a href="https://archive.org/details/opensource_movies">Community Video</a> or <a href="https://archive.org/details/opensource">Community Texts</a>. For instance, see this collection of “<a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-nCoV">Files pertaining to the 2019–20 Wuhan, China Coronavirus outbreak</a>.” We recommend using a common subject tag, like <code>coronavirus</code> to facilitate search and discovery. Fore more information on uploading materials to <a href="https://archive.org/index.php">archive.org</a>, see the <a href="https://help.archive.org/">Internet Archive Help Center</a>.</p>
<p>A special thanks to Alex Thurman of Columbia University and Nicola Bingham of the British Library, the co-chairs of the IIPC CDG, and to other IIPC members participating in the project. Thanks as well to any and all public nominators assisting with identifying and archiving records about this significant global event.</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/30/the-whole-earth-web-archive/" title="5:51 pm">October 30, 2019</a><span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/jefferson/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by jefferson">jefferson</a></span></span></p>
<p>As part of the many releases and announcements for our <a href="https://archive.org/details/world-night-market-2019">October Annual Event</a>, we created <a href="https://webservices.archive.org/wewa">The Whole Earth Web Archive</a>. The Whole Earth Web Archive (WEWA) is a proof-of-concept to explore ways to improve access to the archived websites of underrepresented nations around the world. Starting with a sample set of 50 small nations we extracted their archived web content from the Internet Archive’s web archive, built special search and access features on top of this subcollection, and created a dedicated discovery portal for searching and browsing. Further work will focus on improving IA’s harvesting of the national webs of these and other underrepresented countries as well as expanding collaborations with libraries and heritage organizations within these countries, and via international organizations, to contribute technical capacity to local experts who can identify websites of value that document the lives and activities of their citizens.</p>

<p>Archived materials from the web play an increasingly necessary role in representation, evidence, historical documentation, and accountability. However, the web’s scale is vast, it changes and disappears quickly, and it requires significant infrastructure and expertise to collect and make permanently accessible. Thus, the community of National Libraries and Governments preserving the web remains <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191023192755/http://web.archive.org/screenshot/http://netpreserve.org/about-us/members/">overwhelmingly represented by well-resourced institutions from Europe and North America</a>. We hope the WEWA project helps provide enhanced access to archived material otherwise hard to find and browse in the massive 20+ petabytes of the Wayback Machine. More importantly, we hope the project provokes a broader reflection upon the lack of national diversity in institutions collecting the web and also spurs collective action towards diminishing the overrepresentation of “first world” nations and peoples in the overall global web archive.</p>
<p>As with prior special projects by the Web Archiving &amp; Data Services team, such as <a href="https://gifcities.org/">GifCities</a> (search engine for animated Gifs from the Geocities web collection) or <a href="https://archive.org/details/MilitaryIndustrialPowerpointComplex">Military Industrial Powerpoint Complex</a> (ebooks of Powerpoints from the archive of the .mil (military) web domain), the project builds on our exploratory work to provide improved access to valuable subsets of the web archive. While our <a href="https://archive-it.org/">Archive-It</a> service gives curators the tools to build special collections of the web, we also work to build unique collections from the pre-existing global web archive.</p>
<p>The preliminary set of countries in WEWA were determined by selecting the 50 “smallest” countries as measured by number of websites registered on their national web domain (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain">ccTLD</a>) — a somewhat arbitrary measurement, we acknowledge. The underlying search index is based on internally-developed tools for search of both text and media. Indices are built from features like page titles or descriptive hyperlinks from other pages, with relevance ranking boosted by criteria such as number of inbound links and popularity and include a temporal dimension to account for the historicity of web archives. Additional technical information on search engineering can be found in “<a href="https://fatcat.wiki/release/bmartqgoxjgsrhvgofpbhtcr2e">Exploring Web Archives Through Temporal Anchor Texts</a>.”</p>
<p>We intend both to do more targeted, high-quality archiving of these and other smaller national webs and also have undertaking active outreach to national and heritage institutions in these nations, and to related international organizations, to ensure this work is guided by broader community input. If you are interested in contributing to this effort or have any questions, feel free to email us at webservices [at] archive [dot] org. Thanks for browsing the WEWA!</p>

<p>The Internet Archive has transformed 130,000 references to books in Wikipedia into live links to 50,000 digitized Internet Archive books in several Wikipedia language editions including English, Greek, and Arabic. And we are just getting started. By working with Wikipedia communities and scanning more books, both users and robots will link many more book references directly into Internet Archive books. In these cases, diving deeper into a subject will be a single click.</p>

<p>For example, the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr">Martin Luther King, Jr</a> cites the book <em>To Redeem the Soul of America</em>, by Adam Fairclough. That citation now <a href="https://archive.org/details/toredeemsoulofam00fair/page/299">links directly to page 299</a> inside the digital version of the book provided by the Internet Archive. There are 66 cited and linked books on that article alone. </p>

<p>Readers can see a couple of pages to preview the book and, if they want to read further, they can borrow the digital copy using <a href="https://controlleddigitallending.org/">Controlled Digital Lending</a> in a way that’s analogous to how they borrow physical books from their local library.</p>
<p>“What has been written in books over many centuries is critical to informing a generation of digital learners,” said Brewster Kahle, Digital Librarian of the Internet Archive. “We hope to connect readers with books by weaving books into the fabric of the web itself, starting with Wikipedia.”</p>
<p>You can help accelerate these efforts by <a href="https://openlibrary.org/sponsorship">sponsoring books</a> or funding the effort. It costs the Internet Archive about $20 to digitize and preserve a physical book in order to bring it to Internet readers. The goal is to bring another 4 million important books online over the next several years.  Please <a href="https://archive.org/donate">donate</a> or <a href="mailto:info@archive.org">contact us</a> to help with this project.</p>

<p>The Internet Archive will provide portions of its web archive to the University of Edinburgh to support the School of Informatics’ work building open data and tools for advancing machine translation, especially for low-resource languages. Machine translation is the process of automatically converting text in one language to another.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://paracrawl.eu/">ParaCrawl</a> project is mining translated text from the web in 29 languages.  With over 1 million translated sentences available for several languages, ParaCrawl is often the largest open collection of translations for each language.   The project is a collaboration between the University of Edinburgh, University of Alicante, Prompsit, TAUS, and Omniscien with funding from the EU’s Connecting Europe Facility.  Internet Archive data is vastly expanding the data mined by ParaCrawl and therefore the amount of translated sentences collected. Lead by <a href="https://kheafield.com/">Kenneth Heafield</a> of the University of Edinburgh, the overall project will yield open corpora and open-source tools for machine translation as well as the processing pipeline.  </p>

<p>Archived web data from IA’s general web collections will be used in the project.  Because translations are particularly scarce for Icelandic, Croatian, Norwegian, and Irish, the IA will also use customized internal language classification tools to prioritize and extract data in these languages from archived websites in its collections.</p>
<p>The partnership expands on IA’s ongoing effort to provide computational research services to large-scale data mining projects focusing on open-source technical developments for furthering the public good and open access to information and data. Other recent collaborations include providing web data for assessing the state of local online news nationwide, analyzing historical corporate industry classifications, and mapping online social communities. As well, IA is expanding its work in making available custom extractions and datasets from its 20+ years of historical web data.

<p>The Internet Archive presents the first ever <strong>Military Powerpoint Karaoke:</strong> a night of “Powerpoint Karaoke” using presentations in the <a href="https://archive.org/details/MilitaryIndustrialPowerpointComplex">Military Industrial Powerpoint Complex</a> collection at <a href="http://archive.org/">archive.org</a> that were extracted<span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Internet Archive from its public web archive and converted into a special collection of PDFs/epubs</span>. The event will take place on Tuesday, March 6th at <strong>7:30pm</strong> at our headquarters in San Francisco. The show will be preceded by a <strong>reception at 6:30 pm</strong>, when doors will also open.</p>

<p>Also known as “Battle Decks,” Powerpoint Karaoke is an improvisational and art event where audience members give a presentation using a set of Powerpoint slides that they’ve never seen before. There are three rules: 1) The presenter cannot see the slides before presenting; 2) The presenter delivers each slide in succession without skipping slides or going back; and 3) The presentation ends when all slides are presented, or after 5 minutes (whichever comes first). We’re thrilled to have <strong>Rick Prelinger,</strong> creator of Lost Landscapes and Prelinger Archive, and <strong>Avery Trufelman</strong> of 99% Invisible, joining us to deliver headlining Powerpoint decks. The rest of the presentations will be delivered by you — the audience members who sign up.</p>
<p>This event will use, as its source material, a curated collection of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/MilitaryIndustrialPowerpointComplex">Internet Archive’s Military Industrial Powerpoint Complex</a>, a special project alongside <a href="https://gifcities.org/">GifCities</a> that was originally created for the Internet Archive’s 20th Anniversary in October 2016. For the project, IA staff extracted all the Powerpoint files from its archive of the government’s public .mil web domain. The collection was expanded in early 2017 to include materials collected during the <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2017/05/09/over-200-terabytes-of-the-government-web-archived/">End of Term</a> project, which archived a snapshot of the .gov and .mil web domains during the administration change. The Military Industrial Powerpoint Complex collection contains over 57,000 Powerpoint decks, each charged with material that ranges from the violent to the banal, featuring attack modes, leadership styles, harness types, and modes for requesting vacation days from the US Military. The project was originally inspired by writer Paul Ford’s article, “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604004822/https://medium.com/message/amazing-military-infographics-1ba60bdc32e7">Amazing Military Infographics</a>” which can be found in the Wayback Machine. As a whole, this collection forms a unique snapshot into our government’s Military Industrial Complex.</p>
<p>This event is organized by artists/archivists <a href="http://www.liatberdugo.com/">Liat Berdugo</a> and <a href="http://charliemacquarie.com/">Charlie Macquarie</a> in partnership with the Internet Archive.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/301.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/301-253x300.jpg" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-15675" sizes="(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/301-253x300.jpg 253w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/301-768x910.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/301-864x1024.jpg 864w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/301.jpg 1365w" width="253" height="300" /></a>Jason Scott, free-range archivist, reporting in as 2017 draws to a close.</p>
<p>As part of our end-of-year fundraising drive, I thought it might be fun to tweet highlighted parts of the vast stacks of content that the Internet Archive makes available for free to millions. A lot of folks know about our <a href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> and its 20+ years of website history, but there’s petabytes of media and works available to see throughout the site. I called it “30 Days of Stuff”, and for the last 30 days I’ve been pointing out great items at the Archive, once a day.</p>
<p>You won’t have to swim upstream through my tweets; here on the last day, I’ve compiled the highlighted items in this entry. Enjoy these jewels in the Archive’s collection, a small sample of the wide range of items we provide.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303-199x300.jpg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15676" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303-199x300.jpg 199w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303-678x1024.jpg 678w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303.jpg 720w" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Books and Texts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.org/details/thelatchkey01millarch">The Latch Key of my Bookhouse</a> was one of the first books scanned by the Internet Archive in its book scanner tests, and it’s a 1921 directory of Children’s Literature that is filled with really nice illustrations that came out great.</li>
<li>As part of our ever-growing set of Defense Technical Information Center collection, we have <a href="https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA055327">The Role of the Citizens Band Radio Service and Travelers Information Stations In Civil Preparedness Emergencies Final Report</a>, a 1978 overview of CB Radio and what role it might play in civil emergencies. Many thousands of taxpayer-funded educational and defense items are mirrored in this collection.</li>
<li>Also in the DTIC collection is <a href="https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA095145">The Battalion Commander’s Handbook 1980</a>, which besides the crazy front page of stamps, approvals and sign-offs, is basically a manager’s handbook written from the point of view of the US Army.</li>
<li>There are <a href="https://archive.org/details/tractormanuals">hundreds of tractor manuals</a> at the Archive. Hundreds! Of all types, languages (a lot of them Russian) and level of information. Tractors are one of those tools that can last generations and keeping the maintenance on them in the field can make a huge difference in livelihood.</li>
<li>A lovely 1904 catalog for plums called <a href="https://archive.org/details/CAT31286852">The Maynard Plum Catalogue</a> was scanned in with one of our partner organizations and it’s a breathless and inspiring declaration of the future wonder of the plums this wizard of plum-growing, Luther Burbank, was bringing to the world.</li>
<li>Xerox Corporation released “<a href="https://archive.org/details/TNM_Coloring_Book_A_metamorphosis_of_creative_cop_20170922_0699">A Metamorphosis of Creative Copying</a>” in 1964, which seems to function as both promotion for Xerox and a weird gift to give to your kids to color in.</li>
<li>In 2014, a short zine called <a href="https://archive.org/details/TaoOfBitcoinIssue1">The Tao of Bitcoin</a> was released, telling people the dream of $10,000 bitcoin would be real.</li>
<li>The 1888 chapbook <a href="https://archive.org/details/goodytwoshoes00newyiala">Goody Two-Shoes</a> has lovely illustrations, and a fine short story.</li>
<li>Working with a lovely couple who brought in a <a href="https://archive.org/details/The_Official_Negro_Directory_and_Classified_Buyers_Guide_1942-1943">1942 black-owned-businesses directory</a>, I scanned the pages by hand and put them up into this item.</li>
<li>Inside that directory was an ad for a school of whistling that said it taught using the methods of Agnes Woodward, and a quick scan of the Archive’s stacks showed that we had an entire copy of her book <a href="https://archive.org/details/WhistlingAsAnArt">Whistling as an Art</a>!</li>
<li>The medical treatise <a href="https://archive.org/details/sleepitsderangem00hamm">Sleep and Its Derangements</a>, from 1869, is William A. Hammond, MD’s overview of sleep, and what can go wrong. Scanned from the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine, it’s one of many thousands of books we’ve scanned with partners.</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.org/details/lethartmanfeathe00hart">Let Hartman Feather Your Nest</a> could be described as “A furniture catalog” in the same way the Sistine Chapel could be described as “a place of worship”. The catalog is a thundering, fist-pounding declaration of the superiority of the Hartman enterprise and the quality and breadth of furniture and service that will arrive at your door and be backed up to the far reaches of time.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/302.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/302-229x300.jpg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15677" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/302-229x300.jpg 229w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/302.jpg 602w" width="229" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Magazines</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Photoplay considered itself <em>the</em> magazine for the motion picture industry in the first part of the 20th century, and this <a href="https://archive.org/details/phodec21chic">multi-volume compilation</a> of photos, articles and advertisements is a truly lovely overview.</li>
<li>There’s over <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=maximum%20collection%3Azines">140 issues of the classic Maximum RockNRoll zine</a>, truly the king of music zines for a very long time. On its newsprint pages are howls and screeches of all manner of punk, rock and the needs of musicians.</li>
<li>A magazine created by the Walt Disney Company to trumpet various parts of Disneyland and its attractions was called Vacationland, and this <a href="https://archive.org/details/VacationlandFall1965">Fall 1965 issue</a> covers all sorts of stuff about the park’s first decade.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/304.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/304-300x204.jpg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15678" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/304-300x204.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/304.jpg 574w" width="300" height="204" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Movies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rescued from a warehouse years ago, a collection of Hollywood movie “B-Roll”, unused secondary scenes often filmed by different crew, has been digitized. My personal favorite is <a href="https://archive.org/details/PET1034_R-4">[Western Film Scenes]</a>, which is circa 1950s footage of a Western Town, all of it utterly fake but feeling weirdly real, to be used in a western. Don’t miss everyone standing around looking right at you and looking like they agree quite energetically with you!</li>
<li>No compilation could be complete without the legendary <a href="https://archive.org/details/DuckandC1951">Duck and Cover</a>, a cartoon/PSA that explained the simple ways to avoid injury in a nuclear blast. Just lie down! It’ll be fine. Please note: This Probably Won’t Work. But the song is very catchy.</li>
<li>The very weird <a href="https://archive.org/details/The_Electric-Film_Format_Acid_Test_1990">Electric Film Format Acid Test</a> from 1990 has a semi-interested model holding up a color bar plate in a wide, wide variety of film and video formats. Filmed just a few blocks away from the Internet Archive’s current headquarters.</li>
<li>I snuck in a <a href="https://archive.org/details/brewster_kahle_interview_1992">1992 interview with the Archive’s founder, Brewster Kahle</a>, back when he was 33 and working at WAIS, a company or two before the Archive and where he is asked about his thoughts on information and gathering of data. It’s quite interesting to hear the consistency of thought.</li>
<li>The Office of War Information worked with Disney to create “<a href="https://archive.org/details/DentalHealth1945">Dental Health</a>“, a film to show to troops about proper dental care. It’s a combination of straightforward animation and industrial film-making worth enjoying.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1-300x300.jpg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15679" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1-768x765.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1-1024x1020.jpg 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1.jpg 1142w" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Audio</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have a collection of hours of the radio show <a href="https://archive.org/details/RkoOrsonWelles-TheShadow-RadioRecodings">The Shadow</a> from 1938-1939, starring  Orson Welles at 23, at the height of his performance powers, playing the dual main role.</li>
<li>For Christmas Eve, we pointed to <a href="https://archive.org/details/78_christmas-chopsticks-twas-the-night-before-christmas_fred-heider-bobby-burns-pet_gbia0000281b">“Christmas Chopsticks”</a>, a 1953 78rpm record of “Twas the Night Before Christmas” performed to the tune of the classic piano piece “Chopsticks”; one of tens of thousands of 78rpm records the Archive has been adding this year.</li>
<li>On Christmas, a user of the Archive uploaded two obscure albums he’d purchased on eBay – remnants of the S. S. Kresge Company, which became K-Mart, and which were played over the PA system for shoppers. He got his hands on Albums <a href="https://archive.org/details/S.S.KresgeChristmasBackgroundMusicNo.261">#261</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/S.S.KresgeChristmasBackgroundMusicNo.294">#294</a>.</li>
<li>Earlier in the month before the user uploaded those Christmas albums, I linked to a different holiday collection of K-Mart items, a <a href="https://archive.org/details/KmartDecember1974ReelToReel">1974 Reel-to-Reel</a> that started with a K-Mart jingle and went full holiday from there.</li>
<li>Before he was a (retired) talk show host, and before he was a stand-up comedian, David Letterman worked and trained in radio. Happily, we have <a href="https://archive.org/details/DavidLetterman-WagoBallStateUniversityMuncie-TuesdayApril11969">recordings of Dave Letterman</a>, DJ, from when he was 22, at Ball State University.</li>
<li>Ron “Boogiemonster” Gerber has been hosting his weekly pop music recycling radio show, “Crap from the Past”, for over 25 years, and he’s been uploading and cataloging his show to the Archive for well over 10 of those years, including all the way back to the beginning of his show. The full <a href="https://archive.org/details/crapfromthepast">Crap From The Past</a> archive is up and is hundreds of hours of fun.</li>
<li>The truly weird “<a href="https://archive.org/details/conquer-videogame-craze-album/">Conquer the Video Craze</a>” is a 1982 record album with straightforward descriptions of how to beat games like Centipede, Defender, Stargate, Dig Dug, and more. This album has been sampled from by multiple DJs to bring that extra spice to a track.</li>
<li>Over 3,000 shows at the DNA Lounge are at the archive, including “<a href="https://archive.org/details/DNALOUNGE-2015-03-07">Bootie: Gamer Night</a>“, which combines mash-up tracks and video games. Bootie has been playing at DNA Lounge for years, and puts the audio from one song with the singing from another, and… it’s quite addicting, like games. This night was for the nearby Game Developers’ Conference being held the same week.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/videocraze-800.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/videocraze-800-286x300.jpg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15680" sizes="(max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/videocraze-800-286x300.jpg 286w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/videocraze-800.jpg 763w" width="286" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Software</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2011, as part of a “retrocomputing” competition, we saw the release of “Paku-Paku”, a pac-clone program which ran in an obscure early PC-Compatible graphics mode that was <em>very</em> colorful and <em>very </em>small (160×100) and was built perfectly for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Paku_Paku_2011">You can play the game in your browser by clicking here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.org/details/mac_Psion_Chess">Psion Chess</a> is a game for the Macintosh that can play both you and itself with pretty high levels of skill and really sharp and crisp black and white graphics.  It makes a really great screensaver in self-playing mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>People often overuse a phrase like “Barely scratched the surface”, but I assure you there are millions of amazing items in the archive, and it’s been a pleasure to bring some to light. While the 30 Days of Stuff was a fun way to stretch out a month of fundraising with stuff to see every day, we’re here 24/7 to bring you all these items, and welcome you finding jewels, gems and clunkers throughout our hard drives whenever you want.</p>
<p>Thanks for another year!</p>
