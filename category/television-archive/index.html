<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">A round up on what’s happening at the TV News Archive by Katie Dahl and Nancy Watzman.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we release new data generated by our <a href="https://archive.org/details/faceomatic">Face-o-Matic</a> tool, developed in collaboration with </span><a href="https://www.matroid.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matroid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, adding to our list of public figures detected by facial-recognition on major cable news stations on the  </span><a href="http://archive.org/tv"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TV News Archive.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to President Donald Trump and the four congressional leaders, the expanded list now includes most former living presidents and recent major party presidential contenders, including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. (For the full list of public officials tracked, as well as methodical notes, see bottom of the post.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detecting faces on TV news and turning them into data provides a new quantitative path for journalists and researchers to explore how news is presented to the public and compare and contrast editorial choices that individual networks make. This new measure shows us the duration that politicians’ faces are actually shown on screen, whether it’s a clip of that person speaking, muted footage, or a still photo shown in the background to illustrate a point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding to the </span><a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?DATASET=IATV&amp;TYPE=SUMMARY&amp;STARTDATETIME=&amp;ENDDATETIME="><span style="font-weight: 400;">Television Explorer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, fueled by closed captions and our </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/third-eye"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third Eye</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> chyron reading tool, a wealth of information is now available to analyze. (See the </span><a href="https://archive.org/tv"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TV News Archive home page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for examples of visualizations created by journalists and researchers using TV News Archive data.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are six quick takeaways using Face-o-Matic for an analysis covering roughly six months, from November 2017 through May 2018, looking at four cable TV news networks: BBC News, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.</span></p>

<strong>1. Trump trumps every other political figure in face-time on cable TV news, all the time, every day, in every way, on every network and program.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve seen in past </span><a href="https://blog.archive.org/2017/09/06/face-o-matic-data-show-trump-dominates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Face-o-Matic data, President Donald Trump is the major political star on cable TV news as compared to other top political figures examined. To put this in perspective: over a six month period stretching from November 2017 to May 2018, the president’s face appeared on TV cable news the equivalent of a full 13.5 days, counting every second of face-time. The next closest political figure we analyzed was House Speaker Paul Ryan, R., Wis., whose visage appeared the equivalent of one day. </span></p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>After Trump, GOP leaders in Congress are the most popular faces on TV cable news.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two GOP leaders in Congress, Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R., Ky. are the next most popular faces on TV news cable news networks. Between the two, Ryan ranks first on the TV news cable networks we examined: BBC News, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.  McConnell is the next most shown face on these networks, with the exception of BBC News.</span></p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama figure prominently on Fox News.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News airs proportionately more images of failed presidential candidate 2016 Hillary Clinton and former president Barack Obama than other cable TV news networks. Fox News showed Clinton’s face 7.6 times more than CNN did, and Obama’s 3.6 times more. Fox News also showed Clinton 3.6 times more than MSNBC, and Obama, 2.3 times more.</span></p>

<li><strong>Hannity shows more Hillary Clinton face-time than any other top-rated Fox News show.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does the Fox News “Hannity” program air more images of Hillary Clinton proportionately than any other top rated Fox News show, with just one exception, it is the Fox News show that shows her face more than current congressional leaders–Ryan, McConnell, Schumer or Pelosi. “Hannity” also shows more images of Obama than other top rated Fox News shows.</span></p>

<li><strong>Ryan face-time spikes on news shows aired during morning hours.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three U.S. cable news networks examined showed high rates of face-time for Ryan on shows airing during morning hours, ranging from 9 am to 11 am. This may be linked to his leadership role in Congress and that morning hours are prime for large announcements. For example, on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom” and “Happening Now” <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/tv.news.archive#!/vizhome/Top15programsonFOX_0/FOXtop15">show spikes</a> of face-time for Ryan. On MSNBC, “Live with Hallie Jackson” and “Live with Velshi and Ruhle” <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/tv.news.archive#!/vizhome/Top15programsonMSNBC_0/HighestratedMSNBCshows?publish=yes">show high rates</a> of images for Ryan. And on CNN, “At This Hour with Kate Bolduan” <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/tv.news.archive#!/vizhome/Top10programsonCNN_0/CNNtop10">shows high rates</a> of Ryan as well. </span></p>

<li><strong>BBC News just isn’t that into us.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BBC News provides a window into how news is presented to a major foreign audience. Like U.S. cable news networks, BBC News features more face-time for Trump than other political figures examined. Ryan ranks a distant second. Overall, BBC News, however, shows much lower rates of images of U.S. political figures than U.S. cable news shows do.</span></p>

<strong>Methodological notes</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Face-o-Matic data set, available for download on the Internet Archive, uses facial recognition to track the faces of prominent public officials as they appear on major cable TV news networks: BBC News, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC. The list of public officials tracked, along with the date that detection began, is here:</span></p>
<p><strong>President &amp; current congressional leaders</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald Trump, 7/13/17</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaker Paul Ryan, R., Wis., 7/13/17</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D., Calif., 7/13/17</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R., Ky., 7/13/17</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, D., N.Y., 7/13/17</span></p>
<p><strong>Former living presidents and recent major party presidential candidates*</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George H.W. Bush, 10/5/17</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George W. Bush, 11/1/17</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jimmy Carter, 10/21/17</span></p>
<p>Bill Clinton, 9/12/17</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton, 9/12/17</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barack Obama, 7/13/17</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitt Romney, 10/4/17</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Note: Our data set does not include Sen. John McCain, R., Ariz., who ran for president opposite Obama in 2008. Sample testing of facial detection for the senator revealed a somewhat frequent rate of false positives  – instances where the identified face was not the senator’s, but rather one of a number of lookalikes. While we make no claim that all of the detections in the Face-o-matic data set are error free, we did test faces to minimize these. Please be sure to notify us if you find errors in the data. </span></p>

<p>Posted on <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2018/04/20/recognizingtrumpsvoice/" title="4:20 pm">April 20, 2018</a><span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/nancyw/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by Nancy Watzman">Nancy Watzman</a></span></span></p>
<p><em>A round up on what’s happening at the TV News Archive by Katie Dahl and Nancy Watzman.</em></p>
<p>This week we explore cutting edge work by Joostware that moves us closer to solving the challenge of searching vast archives of video by speaker, note the use of TV News Archive data by <em>The New York Times</em> and Axios, and share a fact-checked interview by exiting House Speaker Paul Ryan about his legacy.</p>
<h2 id="joostware-trained-model-to-recognize-trumps-voice"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joostware trained model to recognize Trump’s voice</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if you wanted to search the <a href="http://archive.org/tv">TV News Archive</a> to find every instance where President Donald Trump is talking?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the research question that the San Francisco-based firm <a href="http://joostware.com/">Joostware</a> concentrated on for its Who Said What project, <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2017/06/28/knight-prototype-fund-winners-use-tv-news-archive-to-fight-misinformation/">which won</a> a $50,000 prototype grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Last week Joostware’s founder, Delip Rao, presented the project’s progress at a gathering in Austin, Texas. (The Internet Archive’s own Dan Schultz, in his Bad Idea Factory incarnation, also presented on Contextubot, which we <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2018/03/08/tv-news-record-glorious-contextubot-making-progress/">recently profiled here.</a>)</span></p>
<p><strong>“<strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audio and video today is viewed as an opaque object and it’s meant for linear consumption,” Rao said in his presentation. “But truly any audio and video especially in the context of news has a lot of structure to it. There are speakers of interest, and these speakers take turns, and then within each turn something was communicated. So our goal is to identify these speakers who are of interest and also the content that was spoken in that turn and indexing that.</span></strong>”</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone can search the TV News Archive already via closed captions at the Internet Archive or via <a href="https://television.gdeltproject.org/">Television Explorer</a>. Our experiments with <a href="https://archive.org/details/faceomatic">facial detection</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/third-eye">chyron extraction</a> are another way to find and analyze news clips. But searching a video archive by “speaker id” – finding all the video where a person is actually talking – is a tough technical challenge. Our <a href="https://archive.org/details/trumparchive">Trump Archive</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/us_congress_archive">congressional,</a> <a href="https://archive.org/details/executive_branch_archive">executive branch</a>, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/trumpadministration">administration</a> archives are all manually curated video collections designed to demonstrate what it would be like to have automated speaker id search.</span></p>
<p>Joostware researchers have made progress toward this goal. They took material from the Trump Archive, and used it to train a model that recognizes the president’s voice, by using properties of the voice signal. They created a prototype search software that is more than 95% accurate on a human annotated dataset in returning video clips where Trump is actually speaking.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s next? With more resources, Joostware hopes to give this technology back to the Internet Archive to improve search within the TV News Archive. And Rao and others continue to work within the larger community of researchers working to crack the code of video to help fact-checkers and journalists hold power accountable.</span></p>
<h2 id="no-one-is-talking-about-tax-law-on-cable-tv-news">No one is talking about tax law on cable TV news</h2>
<p>Jim Tankersley and Karl Russell, reporters for <em>The New York Times,</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/business/economy/tax-law-talking.html">used TV News Archive captions</a> via GDELT’s Television Explorer to demonstrate how little coverage there is on cable TV news for the newly minted $2.5 trillion tax overhaul:</p>
<p>“Consider one of Mr. Trump’s preferred yardsticks: cable news coverage. Throughout the fall, as Republicans rushed their tax bill through Congress in two breakneck months, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC routinely devoted 10 percent of their daily coverage to tax issues, according to <a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?DATASET=IATV&amp;TYPE=SUMMARY&amp;KEYWORDS=trade&amp;TIMESPAN=1y&amp;STARTDATETIME=&amp;ENDDATETIME=&amp;FILTER_STATIONS=station%3ACNN&amp;FILTER_STATIONS=station%3AFOXNEWS&amp;FILTER_STATIONS=station%3AMSNBC&amp;FILTER_COMBSEP=&amp;FILTER_DATANORM=&amp;FILTER_TIMESMOOTH=&amp;SHOW_VOLTIMELINE=INCLUDE_ZOOMABLE&amp;SHOW_STATIONCHART=INCLUDE&amp;SHOW_WORDCLOUD=INCLUDE&amp;SHOW_TOPCLIPS=INCLUDE" class="css-1dccl0s eo5o5yb0">data from the Gdelt Project</a>. Interest spiked as Mr. Trump signed the bill in late December, and then it fell precipitously.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Axios, Caitlin Owens </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/cable-news-cycles-tax-cuts-health-care-stormy-daniels-d75d6bed-bc03-44c3-add5-284970a75bce.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">used</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TV New Archive data with GDELT’s Television Explorer to shed light on whether the TV networks are paying attention the priorities of the political parties: “Tax cuts and the Affordable Care Act are supposed to be big issues in the midterm elections, but both have faded from the attention of the cable news networks now that they’re no longer front and center in Congress.” Owens thinks it matters because “Democrats are campaigning hard on the GOP’s unpopular attempt to repeal and replace the ACA, and Republicans are pushing the financial benefits of their tax law.”</span></p>

<h2 id="fact-check-corporate-tax-revenues-are-rising-misleading"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fact-Check: Corporate tax revenues are rising (misleading)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Paul Ryan, R., Wisc., announced last week he would not be seeking reelection, prompting television interviews that reflected on his legacy. In a “Meet the Press” interview Sunday on NBC, host Chuck Todd asked Ryan to respond to a statement by Sen. Bob Corker, R., Tenn.:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“’This Congress and this administration likely will go down as one of the most fiscally irresponsible administrations and Congresses that we ever had.’ And he’s referring to the fact that this tax bill spiked the deficit. It’s higher than even what was projected.” Ryan responded “That was going to happen. The baby boomers’ retiring was going to do that. These deficit trillion-dollar projections have been out there for a long, long time. Why? Because of mandatory spending, which we call entitlements. Discretionary spending under the CBO baseline is going up about $300 billion over the next 10 years. Tax revenues are still rising. Income tax revenues are still rising. Corporate income tax revenues. Corporate rate got dropped 40 percent, still rising.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Kiely </span><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2018/04/paul-ryan-misleads-on-corporate-tax-revenues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for FactCheck.org that “Ryan is right that $1 trillion deficit projections ‘have been out there for a long, long time…But corporate tax revenues are down for the first six months of the fiscal year, and they are projected to be less over the next 10 years than they otherwise would have been because of the law.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/04/18/dissecting-house-speaker-ryans-remarks-on-deficits-and-spending/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post’s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fact Checker, “The baby-boom generation is retiring, and Congress at best has taken only modest steps to rein in spending on old-age programs, largely because any serious effort is met with hostility and often-misleading attack ads…But the revenue side of the picture cannot be ignored.” “Congress has not been able to grapple with the spending — and  keeps taking steps to undermine the revenue flow as well.”</span></p>

<p><em>A round up on what’s happening at the TV News Archive by Katie Dahl and Nancy Watzman.</em></p>
<p>This week we bring you analyses of cable TV news coverage and fact-checks of recent statements by President Donald Trump on immigration and his proposed wall on the border with Mexico.</p>
<h2 id="vox-post-turn-tv-news-captions-into-media-analysis">Vox &amp; <em>Post</em> turn TV news captions into media analysis</h2>
<p>Vox’s Alvin Chang and <em>The Washington Post’s</em> Philip Bump continue to turn TV News Archive caption data, via <a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?DATASET=IATV&amp;TYPE=SUMMARY&amp;STARTDATETIME=&amp;ENDDATETIME=">Television Explorer</a>, into analyses of current news. Chang analyzes cable TV network coverage of the March for Our Lives, an anti-gun violence demonstration, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/3/26/17163680/fox-news-gun-march-for-our-lives-data">reporting</a> that on Fox News, “There was a massive spike in mentions of the “Second Amendment” or “Constitution” during the peak of the march, and most of those mentions came from pundits and guests on the network.”</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SecondAmendment.png" class="wp-image-16328 size-full" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SecondAmendment.png 1800w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SecondAmendment-300x270.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SecondAmendment-768x691.png 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SecondAmendment-1024x921.png 1024w" width="1800" height="1619" /></p>

He finds that Fox News mentions Clinton the most, while CNN features more coverage of Daniels.</p>

<h2 id="fact-check-weve-started-building-the-wall-mostly-falsethree-pinocchios">Fact-Check: We’ve started building the wall (Mostly False/Three Pinocchios)</h2>
<p>During a press conference with the presidents of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, President Donald Trump <a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20180403_174800_President__Baltic_States_Joint_News_Conference/start/1204/end/1215.6">talked</a> about his proposed border wall between the United States and Mexico: “We have to have strong borders. We need the wall. We’ve started building the wall, as you know, we have a $1.6 billion toward building the wall and fixing existing wall that’s falling down, it was never appropriate in the first place.”</p>
<p>The funding the president references comes from a spending bill recently passed by Congress. The omnibus “bill included $1.6 billion for some projects at the border, but none of that can be used toward the border wall promised during the presidential campaign.” For PolitiFact, Miriam Valverde <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/04/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-claims-border-wall-under-cons/">rates</a> the president’s claim “Mostly False.”</p>
<p>At <em>The Washington Post’</em>s Fact-Checker, Glenn Kessler gives the same claim “three Pinocchios”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The White House failed miserably to achieve its objectives on funding for a border wall, receiving relative peanuts. It sought $25 billion, but ended up with just 5 percent of that. Moreover, the money came with strings attached so that it could only be used for fencing, not the “great” and “beautiful wall” promised by Trump.</p>
<p>In Orwellian fashion, fences have now become walls. Even then, the president has only secured enough money to pay for one-tenth of the new fence/wall he has sought.</p>

<h2 id="fact-check-caravans-of-people-are-coming-to-cross-the-u.s.-mexico-border-half-true">Fact-Check: Caravans of people are coming to cross the U.S.-Mexico border (Half True)</h2>
<p>Just after Fox News aired a segment on a caravan of people from Central America making its way through Mexico toward the United States, the president wrote on Twitter:</p>
<p>“Half True,” <a href="http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2018/apr/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-caravans-people-coming-through-m/">writes</a> W. Gardner Shelby for PolitiFact: “President Trump tweeted that caravans of immigrants are coming to the Mexico-U.S. border… We confirmed that a caravan of 1,200 to 1,500 people from Central America–not caravans–was in southern Mexico, about 900 miles from the Rio Grande, when Trump tweeted. Also, accounts vary on whether all participants are bound to enter the U.S. An organizer estimated that most of the people intend to remain in Mexico.”</p>
<p>Reporting for FactCheck.org, <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/author/robert-farley/" class="author url fn" title="Posts by Robert Farley">Robert Farley</a>, <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/author/eugene-kiely/" class="author url fn" title="Posts by Eugene Kiely">Eugene Kiely</a> and <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/author/lori-robertson/" class="author url fn" title="Posts by Lori Robertson">Lori Robertson</a> <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2018/04/factchecking-trumps-immigration-tweets/">write</a> “Trump’s messages included muddled and inaccurate claims.” They summarize with the following bullet points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contrary to Trump’s assertion, there is no “liberal (Democrat)” law requiring the “Catch &amp; Release” of people caught illegally crossing the border. There are court cases and laws that require some unaccompanied children, families and asylum-seekers to be released in the U.S., pending an immigration hearing. But it’s a stretch to blame those entirely on Democrats.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump said “big flows of people” are illegally entering the U.S. from Mexico “to take advantage of DACA.” In fact, current border-crossers are not eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump said that “caravans” of people were coming to the Southwest border and that Mexico “must stop them.” The caravan, a yearly demonstration, was organized by the activist group Pueblo Sin Fronteras, which says the people walking in the caravan have “a lot of intentions,” with some wanting to stay in Mexico. The caravan is now in southern Mexico, more than 800 miles from the U.S. border.</p>

<p><em>A round up on what’s happening at the TV News Archive by Katie Dahl and Nancy Watzman.</em></p>
<p>This week, we present a<em> Washington Post </em>analysis of coverage of an alleged affair by the president; a Vox piece examining coverage of Andrew McCabe, the former deputy FBI director; and <em>The</em> <em>Toronto Star’s </em>use of a salient clip to illustrate a point about a presidential appointment. We also show fact-checks from FactCheck.org, PolitiFact, and <em>The Washington Post’s</em> Fact-Checker on claims related to banking, public lands, and trade policy.</p>
<h2 id="chicken-egg-question-on-cable-news-coverage-of-alleged-affair">Chicken-egg question on cable news coverage of alleged affair</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN and MSNBC hosts and guests are talking a lot more about the alleged past affair between President Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels than Fox News is, according to Philip Bump’s latest </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/03/19/up-to-speed-on-the-stormy-daniels-story-if-you-watch-fox-probably-not/?utm_term=.6eae3f328c24"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a> for <em>The Washington Post</em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using TV News Archive data via <a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?DATASET=IATV&amp;TYPE=SUMMARY&amp;STARTDATETIME=&amp;ENDDATETIME=">Television Explorer</a>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bump used the analysis as context to dig into a </span><a href="http://www.suffolk.edu/documents/SUPRC/3_1_2018_tables.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released by Suffolk University earlier this month: “One-fifth of Americans said that Fox News was the news or commentary source they trusted the most, a group that was primarily made up of Republicans… There’s a chicken-egg question here. Does Fox give the Stormy Daniels story a light touch because its audience is largely supportive of Trump or is Fox’s audience largely supportive of Trump because of the coverage they see on Fox? Or is it both?”</span></p>

<h2 id="did-fox-news-reporting-contribute-to-perception-of-fired-fbi-official">Did Fox News reporting contribute to perception of fired FBI official?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vox’s Alvin Chang <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/3/19/17138534/fox-news-mccabe-villain">argues</a> a connection between the firing of Andrew McCabe, former FBI deputy director, to a narrative built up over the course of months by Fox News. Using TV News Archive data via Television Explorer, Chang reports</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that “long before he was fired, Fox News… constantly referred to McCabe as the quintessential example of the FBI’s corruption and anti-Trump bias. They hinted that he was plotting several schemes against Trump during the election, leaking information to the press, and was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and Democrats.” This, he writes, allowed FOX News viewers to think it made “perfect sense for Attorney General Jeff Sessions (perhaps directed by Trump) to fire McCabe.” Chang goes on to warn, “This alternate reality is being fed into the president’s mind.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a floor speech, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D., Mass., </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN2_20180307_202900_U.S._Senate_U.S._Senate/start/3208/end/3223"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the latest proposal to make changes to </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dodd-Frank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “This bill is about goosing the bottom line and executive bonuses at the banks that make up the top one half of 1 percent of banks in this country by size. The very tippy-top.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manuela Tobias </span><a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/20/heidi-heitkamp/senate-banking-bill-win-advantage-wall-street/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for PolitiFact: “The bill raises the bar of what is considered a big bank five-fold, which effectively relaxes the standards for large regional banks. Experts warn this also could open a door for bigger Wall Street bank giveaways.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill also has a few provisions affecting banks above $250 billion in assets. However, the effects would largely depend on the Federal Reserve’s interpretation of the law. The biggest banks might be able to get relaxed regulations, but then again, they might not.”</span></p>

<h2 id="fact-check-public-lands-proposal-largest-in-history-false">Fact-Check: Public lands proposal largest in history (False)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Senate hearing on the budget for the Dept. of the Interior, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20180313_163400_Senate_Energy_Hearing_on_Interior_Budget/start/72/end/100"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the president’s proposal “is the largest investment in our public lands infrastructure in our nation’s history. Let me repeat that, this is the largest investment in our public lands infrastructure in the history of this country.”</span></p>

Louis Jacobson reported: “It’s far from assured that the maximum figure of $18 billion in the proposal will ever be reached if enacted. Beyond that, though, Roosevelt’s $3 billion investment in the Civilian Conservation Corps would amount to $53 billion today, and it accounted for vastly more than the Trump proposal as a percentage of federal spending at the time.”</span></p>

P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do … they almost all do … and that’s how I know!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glenn Kessler </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/03/15/heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-wrongly-the-u-s-has-a-trade-deficit-with-canada/?utm_term=.40e8e2e2204b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for <em>T</em></span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>he</em> Washington Post</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Fact Checker that the president is not including services in his analysis of the trade relationship with Canada. He adds: “The president frequently suggests the United States is losing money with these deficits, but countries do not ‘lose’ money on trade deficits. A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first.” Kessler gives the claim four Pinocchios.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Kiely </span><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2018/03/trumps-canadian-trade-tale/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for FactCheck.org that the president’s claim that figures giving the U.S. a trade surplus with Canada are not including timber and energy is “not accurate. The Census Bureau, which is within the U.S. Department of Commerce, said its trade figures do include timber and energy and referred us to two publications that show that the agency does include timber and energy for imports and exports.” </span></p>

<p><em>A round up on what’s happening at the TV News Archive by Katie Dahl and Nancy Watzman.<br />
</em></p>
<p>This week, we present an update on the video context project Glorious Contextubot, two recent news reports that use TV News Archive data, and fact-checks of TV appearances by the DNC chair and the president.</p>
<h2 id="fueled-by-tv-news-archive-the-glorious-contextubot-is-making-progress">Fueled by TV News Archive, the Glorious Contextubot is making progress</h2>
<p>Let’s say a friend posts a YouTube video link to a politician’s statement on Facebook, but you have a feeling it’s taken out of context. The clip is tightly edited, and you’re curious to see the rest of the statement. Was the politician answering a question? Was the statement part of a larger discussion?</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/grants/8010">Glorious ContextuBot</a>. For the past nine months, veteran media innovators <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2017/04/27/tv-news-lab-hyperaudio-improving-tv-news-video-captioning-and-sharing/">Mark Boas</a> and Laurian Gridnoc of <a href="http://hyperaud.io/">Hyperaudio</a> and <a href="https://trint.com/">Trint</a>, led by the Internet Archive’s own Dan Schultz, senior creative technologist of the TV News Archive, have been building a prototype of the Contextubot, fueled by the <a href="https://archive.org/details/tv">TV News Archive</a>. The <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2017/06/28/knight-prototype-fund-winners-use-tv-news-archive-to-fight-misinformation/">Contextubot</a> is one of <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/press/releases/knight-prototype-fund-awards-1-million-to-20-projects-to-improve-the-flow-of-accurate-information">20 winners</a> of the Knight Prototype Fund’s $1 million challenge, announced in June 2017.</p>

<p>With the ContextuBot, it’s possible to use video to search video. Just paste a link to a video snippet into an interface and then pull up a transcript that puts things in context of what came before and after. Built from the <a href="https://github.com/slifty/tvarchive-duplitron">Duplitron 5000</a>, an audio fingerprinting tool Schultz developed to track political ads for the <a href="http://politicaladarchive.org/">Political TV Ad Archive</a>, the ContextuBot demonstrates how open technology built by the TV team can be repurposed and improved by motivated technologists – one that’s already captured the attention of the University of Iowa Informatics department, which is considering adopting it for researchers.</p>
<p>To date, the team has:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Made it easier to scale audio search.</strong> It’s now possible to scale up and down audio fingerprint finding within a corpus of TV news by adding or removing individual computers or compute clusters.  Our Duplitron would take eight hours to search a year of television, but the ContextuBot makes it much easier to spread that computing across multiple machines.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Built a demo interface.</strong> You can see a clip in context with a transcript of what comes before and after. Click on a word in the transcript, and you’ll be able to jump to that point in the video stream.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Begun to explore a “comic view.”</strong>  The team’s biggest goal is to explore ways to communicate the essence of a longer clip in a short amount of time.  One approach: converting video into a comic. This would set the groundwork for automatically extracting (and rendering) a storyboard from a video clip.</li>
</ul>
<p>The team will present the prototype shortly before the <a href="https://www.isoj.org/">International Symposium of Online Journalism conference</a> in Austin in April 2018.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez <a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20180304_230000_Newsmakers_Tom_Perez_DNC/start/1140.5/end/1153.7">said,</a> “We raised more money in January… of 2018 than any January in our history. So if the question is, ‘Do we have enough money to implement our game plan?’ Absolutely.”</p>
<p>This claim earned “two Pinocchios” from Salvador Rizzo, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/03/07/tom-perezs-claim-that-dnc-broke-fundraising-records-in-january/?utm_term=.3e63a622fbcd">reporting</a> for <em>The Washington Post’s</em> Fact Checker:  the “DNC raised $6 million in January 2018… That was below what it raised in January 2014 ($6.6 million), January 2012 ($13.2 million), January 2011 ($7.1 million) and January 2010 ($9.1 million).”  A spokesman for Perez “backed off from those comments when we reached out with FEC figures that told a different story.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2018/03/trumps-misleading-gun-rhetoric/">Reporting</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by FactCheck.org’s Eugene Kiley, Lori Robertson, and Robert Farley calls this statement misleading.  “As a result of the legislation, Toomey’s rating with the NRA dropped from an “A” to a “C,” and the endorsements and contributions Toomey got from the NRA in previous House and Senate races disappeared. In 2016, the NRA stayed out of Toomey’s Senate race altogether; his Democratic opponent, Katie McGinty, had an “F” grade from the NRA. In that race, Toomey got the endorsement of a gun-control group, Everytown for Gun Safety, which ran ads supporting him.”</span></p>

<p><a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?DATASET=IATV">Television Explorer</a>, a tool to search closed captions from the <a href="http://archive.org/tv">TV News Archive</a>, keeps getting better. Last week GDELT’s Kalev Leetaru added <a href="https://blog.gdeltproject.org/the-new-television-explorer-launches/">new and improved features</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>163 channels are now available to search, from C-Span to Al Jazeera to Spanish language content from Univision and Telemundo.</li>
<li>Results now come as a percentage of 15 second clips, making comparisons between simpler.</li>
<li>The context word function for searches is similarly redesigned, counting a matching 15-second clip as well searching the 15 second clips immediately before and after, helping to alleviate some previous issues with overcounting.</li>
<li>You can now see normalization timelines on the site, with newly available data about the total number of 15-second clips monitored each day and hour included in your query.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s what we found when we used the new tools to track the use of the term, “cryptocurrency.” The rapid ascent, and sometimes fall, of the value of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have led to rises and dips in TV news coverage as well. In May 2017, international TV news channels began to run stories featuring the term, rapidly increasing in November and peaking just last week with BBC News.

<p>Within a broader analysis of how responses to the most recent school shooting compare with others, <em>The Washington Post’s </em>Philip Bump used TV News Archive closed caption data using GDELT’s Television Explorer to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/02/20/how-the-response-to-the-shooting-in-parkland-compares-to-other-recent-massacres/?utm_term=.96a5d9bcb838">examine</a> the pattern of use of the term “gun control” on CNN, Fox, and MSNBC. “After the mass shooting in Las Vegas last October, a political discussion about banning ‘bump stocks’ — devices that allowed the shooter to increase his rate of fire — soon collapsed.” “So far, the conversation after Parkland looks similar to past patterns.”</p>

<p><strong>“I never said Russia did not meddle in the election”</strong></p>
<p>Reacting to the indictments of Russian nationals by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, President Donald Trump wrote, “I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said, ‘It may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.’ The Russian “hoax” was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia – it never did!”</p>

<p><em>A round up on what’s happening at the TV News Archive by Katie Dahl and Nancy Watzman. Additional research by Robin Chin.</em></p>
<p>This week we present new TV news search features, inventory data of TV news recordings from GDELT, and the State of the Union, fact-checked by national fact-checking partners.</p>
<h2 id="new-tv-news-search-features">New TV news search features</h2>
<p>We’re pleased to announce new search options on the <a href="http://archive.org/tv">TV News Archive</a>, making it easier to find what you’re looking for, as well as integrating TV news material into global search at the Internet Archive. The work of TV Architect Tracey Jaquith, and designed by Carolyn Li-Madeo, these new features include:</p>
<p><strong>Search TV news captions directly from Archive.org. </strong>“Search TV news captions” is now a selectable item on the main search bar at the Internet Archive. You no longer need to start from the <a href="http://archive.org/tv">TV News Archive home page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="for-power-users-gdelt-now-offers-downloadable-historical-inventory-of-tv-news-archive-recordings">For power users, GDELT now offers downloadable historical inventory of TV News Archive recordings</h2>
<p>If you are doing an advanced analysis of captioning or other TV News Archive metadata, it can be helpful to know the exact TV News Archive recordings on a given date and time. Thanks to data scientist Kalev Leetaru, this information is now available on GDELT in a downloadable format.</p>
<p>“Inevitably with an archive this massive spanning back to 2009 there will be brief outages or other disruptions and some stations may be monitored for only a specific period of time (such as adding local stations in key markets during specific months of a national election cycle),” <a href="https://blog.gdeltproject.org/television-explorer-new-inventory-tables/">writes</a> Leetaru.</p>
<p>Knowing the exact broadcasts captured can help analysts who want to make sure a trend they are seeing – for example, a big dip or large increase in mentions of a particular term – is a valid trend or a reflection of outages or new stations added over a specific time period.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can download all CSV files via the following URL (replace YYYYMMDD with the date of interest):</p>
<ul>
<li>http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv3/iatv/inventory/YYYYMMDD.inventory.csv</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to request the inventory of shows monitored on the very first official day of the Archive’s existance, use the URL <a href="http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv3/iatv/inventory/20090616.inventory.csv" class="uri">http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv3/iatv/inventory/20090616.inventory.csv</a> or to request the inventory for February 2, 2018, use the URL <a href="http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv3/iatv/inventory/20180202.inventory.csv" class="uri">http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv3/iatv/inventory/20180202.inventory.csv</a>.</p>

<p>For example, all three fact-checking organizations checked President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/KQED_20180131_020000_State_of_the_Union_Address/start/1234/end/1246.6">statement</a>, “<span style="font-weight: 400;">We enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.”</span></p>

And as a percentage of GDP, it ranks seventh. We rate the statement False.”</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2018/01/factchecking-trumps-state-union/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FactCheck.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “CRFB [Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget] said the tax cut in 1981 under President Ronald Reagan, at 2.9 percent of GDP, is the largest in history.”</span></li>

Similar data from the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg show that the ratio between what top CEOs and their workers make is closer to 200 to 1.”</span></li>

<p>Posted on <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2018/01/25/tv-news-record-state-of-the-union-past-and-future/" title="5:34 pm">January 25, 2018</a><span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/nancyw/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by Nancy Watzman">Nancy Watzman</a></span></span></p>
<p><em>A round up on what’s happening at the TV News Archive by Katie Dahl and Nancy Watzman. Additional research by Robin Chin.</em></p>
<p>When President Donald Trump takes the podium to deliver his first official State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, January 30,  he’ll be <a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN3_20160111_044500_History_of_the_State_of_the_Union_Address/start/117.5/end/150.2">following in the footsteps of</a> the nation’s very first president, George Washington, long before there was cable TV or radio.</p>
<p>In Washington’s time, the speech was not yet known as the State of the Union, but the annual message, and according to Donald Ritchie, former U.S. Senate historian, <a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN3_20160111_044500_History_of_the_State_of_the_Union_Address/start/117.5/end/150.2">seen here in a clip</a> from C-Span, the practice was “to [physically] cut the State of the Union message up into paragraphs and create committees to address each one of the issues the president suggested.” There were no standing committees in Congress at that time. Now it’s fact-checkers who examine the speech, line by line, and since 2017, we’ve been annotating our TV news programs with <a href="https://archive.org/details/factchecked">fact-checks</a> of Trump, top administration officials, and the four top congressional leaders, Democrat and Republican.</p>
<p><em>Make history by being a beta tester of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/factstream/id1327422405…">FactStream</a>, a new free app for iPhone or iPad, which will deliver live fact-checks of Trump’s State of the Union address from national fact-checking organizations. The app is a product of Duke Reporters Lab Tech &amp; Check collective, of which the Internet Archive’s TV News Archive is a member. We’ll be adding the fact-checks to the <a href="http://archive.org/tv">TV News Archive</a>, too.</em></p>
<p>At the <a href="http://archive.org/tv">TV News Archive,</a> we’ve got historical footage of some past State of the Union addresses, listed below. Last year we annotated <a href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN2_20170301_020300_President_Trump_Addresses_Joint_Session_of_Congress/start/1289.6/end/1304">Trump’s address to Congress</a> – not officially a State of the Union, since he was newly inaugurated – with fact-checks from our fact-checking partners, FactCheck.org, PolitiFact, and <em>The Washington Post’s</em> Fact Checker. Fact-checks are noted with a red check mark on the TV News Archive filmstrip screen.</p>

<p>For example, the above segment of Trump’s 2017 speech, marked with a red check mark, was fact-checked by both PolitiFact and <em>The Washington Post’s </em>Fact Checker. Trump said, “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.”</p>
<p>PolitiFact’s Miriam Valverde <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/02/donald-trump/trump-misleads-claim-about-terrorism-convictions-9/">rated</a> this claim as “mostly false”: “Trump’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.” Michelle Ye Hee Lee, writing for <em>The Washington Post’s </em>Fact Checker <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/08/15/president-trumps-claim-that-foreigners-comprise-the-vast-majority-of-terrorism-convictions-since-911/?utm_term=.952d94c334c6">gave</a> the claim “four Pinocchios,” stating it relied on “a grossly exaggerated misuse of federal data.”</p>
