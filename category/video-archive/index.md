[Audio / Video player updated ‚Äì to jwplayer v8.2](https://blog.archive.org/2018/04/11/audio-video-player-updated-to-jwplayer-v8-2/)
===================================================================================================================================

Posted on [April 11, 2018](https://blog.archive.org/2018/04/11/audio-video-player-updated-to-jwplayer-v8-2/ "9:07 pm")<span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/traceypooh/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by traceypooh">traceypooh</a></span></span>

We updated our audio/video (and TV) 3rd party JS-based player from v6.8 to v8.2 today.

This was updated with some code to have the same feature set as before, as well as new:

-   much nicer **cosmetic/look** updates
-   nice **‚Äúrewind 10 seconds‚Äù button**
-   controls are now in an updated control bar
-   (video) **‚ÄòRelated Items‚Äô** now uses the same (better) recommendations from the bottom of an archive.org /details/ page
-   Airplay (Safari) and Chromecast **basic casting controls** in player
-   playback **speed rate control** now easier to use / set
-   playback **keyboard control** with `SPACE`¬†and `left`¬†, `right`¬†and `up`, `down`¬†keys
-   (video) Web VTT (captions) has much better user interface and display
-   **flash** is now *only* used to play audio/video if html5 doesnt work (flash does not do layout or controls now)

Here‚Äôs some before / after screenshots:

[Archive video now supports WebVTT for captions](https://blog.archive.org/2018/03/07/archive-video-now-supports-webvtt-for-captions/)
=====================================================================================================================================

Posted on [March 7, 2018](https://blog.archive.org/2018/03/07/archive-video-now-supports-webvtt-for-captions/ "10:04 pm")<span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/traceypooh/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by traceypooh">traceypooh</a></span></span>

We now support **.vtt files**¬†**(Web Video Text Tracks)** in addition to **.srt (SubRip)**¬†(.srt we have supported for years) files for captioning your videos.

It‚Äôs as simple as uploading a ‚Äúparallel filename‚Äù to your video file(s).

Examples:

-   myvid.mp4
-   myvid.srt
-   myvid.vtt

Multi-lang support:

-   myvid.webm
-   myvid.en.vtt
-   myvid.en.srt
-   myvid.es.vtt

Here‚Äôs a nice example item:

VTT with caption picker (and upcoming A/V player too!)

(We will have an updated A/V player with a better ‚Äúpicker‚Äù for so many language tracks in days, have no fear üòé

Enjoy!

As part of our end-of-year fundraising drive, I thought it might be fun to tweet highlighted parts of the vast stacks of content that the Internet Archive makes available for free to millions. A lot of folks know about our [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) and its 20+ years of website history, but there‚Äôs petabytes of media and works available to see throughout the site. I called it ‚Äú30 Days of Stuff‚Äù, and for the last 30 days I‚Äôve been pointing out great items at the Archive, once a day.

You won‚Äôt have to swim upstream through my tweets; here on the last day, I‚Äôve compiled the highlighted items in this entry. Enjoy these jewels in the Archive‚Äôs collection, a small sample of the wide range of items we provide.

[<img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303-199x300.jpg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15676" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303-199x300.jpg 199w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303-678x1024.jpg 678w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303.jpg 720w" width="199" height="300" />](http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303.jpg)

**Books and Texts**

-   [The Latch Key of my Bookhouse](https://archive.org/details/thelatchkey01millarch) was one of the first books scanned by the Internet Archive in its book scanner tests, and it‚Äôs a 1921 directory of Children‚Äôs Literature that is filled with really nice illustrations that came out great.
-   As part of our ever-growing set of Defense Technical Information Center collection, we have [The Role of the Citizens Band Radio Service and Travelers Information Stations In Civil Preparedness Emergencies Final Report](https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA055327), a 1978 overview of CB Radio and what role it might play in civil emergencies. Many thousands of taxpayer-funded educational and defense items are mirrored in this collection.
-   Also in the DTIC collection is [The Battalion Commander‚Äôs Handbook 1980](https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA095145), which besides the crazy front page of stamps, approvals and sign-offs, is basically a manager‚Äôs handbook written from the point of view of the US Army.
-   There are [hundreds of tractor manuals](https://archive.org/details/tractormanuals) at the Archive. Hundreds! Of all types, languages (a lot of them Russian) and level of information. Tractors are one of those tools that can last generations and keeping the maintenance on them in the field can make a huge difference in livelihood.
-   A lovely 1904 catalog for plums called [The Maynard Plum Catalogue](https://archive.org/details/CAT31286852)¬†was scanned in with one of our partner organizations and it‚Äôs a breathless and inspiring declaration of the future wonder of the plums this wizard of plum-growing, Luther Burbank, was bringing to the world.
-   Xerox Corporation released ‚Äú[A Metamorphosis of Creative Copying](https://archive.org/details/TNM_Coloring_Book_A_metamorphosis_of_creative_cop_20170922_0699)‚Äù in 1964, which seems to function as both promotion for Xerox and a weird gift to give to your kids to color in.
-   In 2014, a short zine called [The Tao of Bitcoin](https://archive.org/details/TaoOfBitcoinIssue1) was released, telling people the dream of $10,000 bitcoin would be real.
-   The 1888 chapbook¬†[Goody Two-Shoes](https://archive.org/details/goodytwoshoes00newyiala) has lovely illustrations, and a fine short story.
-   Working with a lovely couple who brought in a [1942 black-owned-businesses directory](https://archive.org/details/The_Official_Negro_Directory_and_Classified_Buyers_Guide_1942-1943), I scanned the pages by hand and put them up into this item.
-   Inside that directory was an ad for a school of whistling that said it taught using the methods of Agnes Woodward, and a quick scan of the Archive‚Äôs stacks showed that we had an entire copy of her book [Whistling as an Art](https://archive.org/details/WhistlingAsAnArt)!
-   The medical treatise [Sleep and Its Derangements](https://archive.org/details/sleepitsderangem00hamm), from 1869, is William A. Hammond, MD‚Äôs overview of sleep, and what can go wrong. Scanned from the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine, it‚Äôs one of many thousands of books we‚Äôve scanned with partners.
-   [Let Hartman Feather Your Nest](https://archive.org/details/lethartmanfeathe00hart) could be described as ‚ÄúA furniture catalog‚Äù in the same way the Sistine Chapel could be described as ‚Äúa place of worship‚Äù. The catalog is a thundering, fist-pounding declaration of the superiority of the Hartman enterprise and the quality and breadth of furniture and service that will arrive at your door and be backed up to the far reaches of time.

**Magazines**

-   Photoplay considered itself¬†*the* magazine for the motion picture industry in the first part of the 20th century, and this [multi-volume compilation](https://archive.org/details/phodec21chic) of photos, articles and advertisements is a truly lovely overview.
-   There‚Äôs over [140 issues of the classic Maximum RockNRoll zine](https://archive.org/search.php?query=maximum%20collection%3Azines), truly the king of music zines for a very long time. On its newsprint pages are howls and screeches of all manner of punk, rock and the needs of musicians.
-   A magazine created by the Walt Disney Company to trumpet various parts of Disneyland and its attractions was called Vacationland, and this [Fall 1965 issue](https://archive.org/details/VacationlandFall1965) covers all sorts of stuff about the park‚Äôs first decade.

[<img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/304-300x204.jpg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15678" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/304-300x204.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/304.jpg 574w" width="300" height="204" />](http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/304.jpg)

**Movies**

-   Rescued from a warehouse years ago, a collection of Hollywood movie ‚ÄúB-Roll‚Äù, unused secondary scenes often filmed by different crew, has been digitized. My personal favorite is [\[Western Film Scenes\]](https://archive.org/details/PET1034_R-4), which is circa 1950s footage of a Western Town, all of it utterly fake but feeling weirdly real, to be used in a western. Don‚Äôt miss everyone standing around looking right at you and looking like they agree quite energetically with you!
-   No compilation could be complete without the legendary [Duck and Cover](https://archive.org/details/DuckandC1951), a cartoon/PSA that explained the simple ways to avoid injury in a nuclear blast. Just lie down! It‚Äôll be fine. Please note: This Probably Won‚Äôt Work. But the song is very catchy.
-   The very weird [Electric Film Format Acid Test](https://archive.org/details/The_Electric-Film_Format_Acid_Test_1990) from 1990 has a semi-interested model holding up a color bar plate in a wide, wide variety of film and video formats. Filmed just a few blocks away from the Internet Archive‚Äôs current headquarters.
-   I snuck in a [1992 interview with the Archive‚Äôs founder, Brewster Kahle](https://archive.org/details/brewster_kahle_interview_1992), back when he was 33 and working at WAIS, a company or two before the Archive and where he is asked about his thoughts on information and gathering of data. It‚Äôs quite interesting to hear the consistency of thought.
-   The Office of War Information worked with Disney to create ‚Äú[Dental Health](https://archive.org/details/DentalHealth1945)‚Äú, a film to show to troops about proper dental care. It‚Äôs a combination of straightforward animation and industrial film-making worth enjoying.

[<img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1-300x300.jpg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15679" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1-768x765.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1-1024x1020.jpg 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1.jpg 1142w" width="300" height="300" />](http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1.jpg)

**Audio**

-   We have a collection of hours of the radio show [The Shadow](https://archive.org/details/RkoOrsonWelles-TheShadow-RadioRecodings) from 1938-1939, starring¬† Orson Welles at 23, at the height of his performance powers, playing the dual main role.
-   For Christmas Eve, we pointed to [‚ÄúChristmas Chopsticks‚Äù](https://archive.org/details/78_christmas-chopsticks-twas-the-night-before-christmas_fred-heider-bobby-burns-pet_gbia0000281b), a 1953 78rpm record of ‚ÄúTwas the Night Before Christmas‚Äù performed to the tune of the classic piano piece ‚ÄúChopsticks‚Äù; one of tens of thousands of 78rpm records the Archive has been adding this year.
-   On Christmas, a user of the Archive uploaded two obscure albums he‚Äôd purchased on eBay ‚Äì remnants of the S. S. Kresge Company, which became K-Mart, and which were played over the PA system for shoppers. He got his hands on Albums [\#261](https://archive.org/details/S.S.KresgeChristmasBackgroundMusicNo.261) and [\#294](https://archive.org/details/S.S.KresgeChristmasBackgroundMusicNo.294).
-   Earlier in the month before the user uploaded those Christmas albums, I linked to a different holiday collection of K-Mart items, a [1974 Reel-to-Reel](https://archive.org/details/KmartDecember1974ReelToReel) that started with a K-Mart jingle and went full holiday from there.
-   Before he was a (retired) talk show host, and before he was a stand-up comedian, David Letterman worked and trained in radio. Happily, we have [recordings of Dave Letterman](https://archive.org/details/DavidLetterman-WagoBallStateUniversityMuncie-TuesdayApril11969), DJ, from when he was 22, at Ball State University.
-   Ron ‚ÄúBoogiemonster‚Äù Gerber has been hosting his weekly pop music recycling radio show, ‚ÄúCrap from the Past‚Äù, for over 25 years, and he‚Äôs been uploading and cataloging his show to the Archive for well over 10 of those years, including all the way back to the beginning of his show. The full [Crap From The Past](https://archive.org/details/crapfromthepast) archive is up and is hundreds of hours of fun.
-   The truly weird ‚Äú[Conquer the Video Craze](https://archive.org/details/conquer-videogame-craze-album/)‚Äù is a 1982 record album with straightforward descriptions of how to beat games like Centipede, Defender, Stargate, Dig Dug, and more. This album has been sampled from by multiple DJs to bring that extra spice to a track.
-   Over 3,000 shows at the DNA Lounge are at the archive, including ‚Äú[Bootie: Gamer Night](https://archive.org/details/DNALOUNGE-2015-03-07)‚Äú, which combines mash-up tracks and video games. Bootie has been playing at DNA Lounge for years, and puts the audio from one song with the singing from another, and‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs quite addicting, like games. This night was for the nearby Game Developers‚Äô Conference being held the same week.

**Software**

-   In 2011, as part of a ‚Äúretrocomputing‚Äù competition, we saw the release of ‚ÄúPaku-Paku‚Äù, a pac-clone program which ran in an obscure early PC-Compatible graphics mode that was¬†*very* colorful and¬†*very¬†*small (160√ó100) and was built perfectly for it. [You can play the game in your browser by clicking here](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Paku_Paku_2011).
-   [Psion Chess](https://archive.org/details/mac_Psion_Chess) is a game for the Macintosh that can play both you and itself with pretty high levels of skill and really sharp and crisp black and white graphics.¬† It makes a really great screensaver in self-playing mode.

People often overuse a phrase like ‚ÄúBarely scratched the surface‚Äù, but I assure you there are millions of amazing items in the archive, and it‚Äôs been a pleasure to bring some to light. While the 30 Days of Stuff was a fun way to stretch out a month of fundraising with stuff to see every day, we‚Äôre here 24/7 to bring you all these items, and welcome you finding jewels, gems and clunkers throughout our hard drives whenever you want.

[archive.org download counts of collections of items updates and fixes](https://blog.archive.org/2015/01/26/archive-org-download-counts-of-collections-of-items-updates-and-fixes/)
===================================================================================================================================================================================

Posted on [January 26, 2015](https://blog.archive.org/2015/01/26/archive-org-download-counts-of-collections-of-items-updates-and-fixes/ "8:46 pm")<span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/traceypooh/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by traceypooh">traceypooh</a></span></span>

Every month, we look over the total download counts for all public items at archive.org. ¬†We sum item counts into their collections. ¬†At year end 2014, we found various source reliability issues, as well as overcounting for ‚Äútop collections‚Äù and many other issues.

[<img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/all-public-items.png" alt="archive.org public items tracked over time" class="wp-image-9148 size-full" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/all-public-items.png 531w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/all-public-items-300x223.png 300w" width="531" height="396" />](https://archive.org/services/views/)

archive.org public items tracked over time

To address the problems we did:
-------------------------------

-   Rebuilt a new system to use our database (DB) for item download counts, instead of our less reliable (and more prone to ‚Äúdrift‚Äù) SOLR search engine (SE).
-   Changed monthly saved data from JSON and PHP serialized flatfiles to new DB table ‚Äî much easier to use now!
-   Fixed overcounting issues for collections: texts, audio, etree, movies
-   Fixed various overcounting issues related to not unique-ing &lt;collection&gt; and &lt;contributor&gt; tags (more below)
-   Fixes to character encoding issues on &lt;contributor&gt; tags

Bonus points!
-------------

-   We now track \*all collections\*. ¬†Previously, we only tracked items tagged:
    -   &lt;mediatype&gt; texts
    -   &lt;mediatype&gt; etree
    -   &lt;mediatype&gt; audio
    -   &lt;mediatype&gt; movies
-   For items we are tracking &lt;contributor&gt; tags (texts items), we now have a ‚ÄúContributor page‚Äù that shows a table of historical data.
-   Graphs are now ‚Äúresponsive‚Äù (scale in width based on browser/mobile width)

¬†

The Overcount Issue for top collection/mediatypes
-------------------------------------------------

-   In the below graph, mediatypes and collections are shown horizontally, with a sample ‚Äúcollection hierarchy‚Äù today.
-   For each collection/mediatype, we show 1 example item, A B C and D, with a downloads/streams/views count next to it parenthetically. ¬† So these are four items, spanning four collections, that happen to be in a collection hierarchy (a single item can belong to multiple collections at archive.org)
-   The Old Way had a critical flaw ‚Äî it summed all sub-collection counts ‚Äî when really it should have just summed all \*direct child\*¬†sub-collection counts (or gone with our New Way instead)

[<img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/overcount.png" alt="overcount" class="aligncenter wp-image-9151 size-full" width="692" height="406" />](http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/overcount.png)

So we now treat &lt;mediatype&gt; tags like &lt;collection&gt; tags, in terms of counting, and unique all &lt;collection&gt; tags to avoid items w/ minor nonideal data tags and another kind of overcounting.

¬†

‚Ä¶ and one more update from Feb/1:
---------------------------------

We graph the ‚Äúdifference‚Äù between absolute downloads counts for the current month minus the prior month, for each month we have data for. ¬†This gives us graphs that show downloads/month over time. ¬†However, values can easily go \*negative\* with various scenarios (which is \*wickedly\* confusing to our poor users!)

### Here‚Äôs that situation:

A collection has a really \*hot\* item one month, racking up downloads in a given collection. ¬†The next month, a DMCA takedown or otherwise removes the item from being available (and thus counted in the future). ¬†The downloads for that collection can plummet the next month‚Äôs run when¬†the counts are summed¬†over public items for that collection again. ¬†So that collection would have a negative (net) downloads count change for this next month!

### Here‚Äôs our fix:

Use the current month‚Äôs collection ‚Äúitem membership‚Äù list for current month \*and\* prior month. ¬†Sum counts for all those items for both months, and make the graphed difference be that difference. ¬†In just about every situation that remains, graphed monthly download counts will be monotonic (nonnegative and increasing or zero).

*When the American people find out how their government has secretly interpreted the Patriot Act, they are going to be stunned and they are going to be angry.* ¬†Senator Ron Wyden May 26, 2011

Recent revelations of the extent of National Security Agency surveillance and weakening of our digital infrastructure give substance to the warnings of Senator Wyden and others. To assist journalists and other concerned citizens in reflecting on these issues, the Internet Archive has created a curated library of short television news clips presenting key statements and other representations.

**[NSA-issues TV News Quote Library](https://archive.org/details/nsa)**

The experimental, Chrome and Safari only, library launches today with more than 700 chronologically ordered television citations drawn from the Archive‚Äôs [television news research service](http://archive.org/details/tv). The TV quotes can be browsed by rolling over clip thumbnails, queried via transcripts and sorted for specific speakers. Citation links, context, links to source broadcasters and options to borrow can be explored by following the More/Borrow links on each thumbnail.

[new mp4 (h.264) derivative technique ‚Äî simpler and easy!](https://blog.archive.org/2013/02/09/new-mp4-h-264-derivative-technique-simpler-and-easy/)

Greetings video geeks! ¬†üòé

We‚Äôve updated the process and way we create our .mp4 files that are shown on video pages on archive.org

<span style="font-size: 16px;">It‚Äôs a much cleaner/clearer process, namely:</span>

-   We opted to **ditch ffpreset files in favor of command-line argument 100% equivalents.**¬† It seems a bit easier for someone reading the task log of their item, trying to see what we did.
-   We **no longer need qt-faststart** step and dropped it. ¬†we use the cmd-line modern ffmpeg ‚Äú-movflags faststart‚Äù
-   Entire processing is now done **100% with ffmpeg**, in the standard ‚Äú2-pass‚Äù mode
-   As before, this derivative plays in modern html5 video tag compatible browsers, plays in flash plugin within browsers, and works on all iOS devices. ¬† it also makes sure the ‚Äúmoov atom‚Äù is at the front of the file, so browsers can playback before downloading the entire file, etc.)

<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="line-height: 21.81818199157715px;">Here is an example (you would tailor especially the ‚Äúscale=640:480‚Äù depending on source aspect ratio and desired output size; ¬†change or drop altogether the ‚Äú-r 20‚Äù option (the source was 20 fps, so we make the dest 20 fps); ¬†tailor the bitrate args to taste):</span></span>

[new video and audio player ‚Äî video multiple qualities, related videos, and more!](https://blog.archive.org/2013/02/09/new-video-and-audio-player-video-multiple-qualities-related-videos-and-more/)
====================================================================================================================================================================================================

Many of you have already noticed that since the New Year, we have migrated our new ‚Äúbeta‚Äù player to be the primary/default player, then to be the only player.

We are excited about this new player!  
It features the very **latest release of jwplayer** from [longtailvideo.com](http://longtailvideo.com).

Here‚Äôs some new features/improvements worth mentioning:

-   **html5 is now the default** ‚Äî flash is a fallback option. ¬†a final fallback option for most items is a ‚Äúfile download‚Äù link from the ‚Äúclick to play‚Äù image
-   videos have a nice new **‚ÄúRelated Videos‚Äù** pane that shows at the end of playback
-   **should be much more reliable** ‚Äî I had previously hacked up a lot of the JS and flash from the jwplayer release version to accommodate our various wants and looks ‚Äî now we use mostly the stock player with minimal JS alterations/customizations around the player.
-   **better HD video and other quality options** ‚Äî uploaders can now offer multiple video size and bitrate qualities. ¬†If you know how to code web playable (see my next post!) h.264 mp4 videos especially, you can upload different qualities of our source video and the viewer will have to option to pick any of them (see more on that below).
-   **more consistent UI and look and feel. ¬†**The longtailvideo team \*really\* cleaned up and improved their UI, giving everything a clean, consistent, and aesthetically pleasing look. ¬†Their default ‚Äúskin‚Äù is also greatly improved, so we can use that now directly too
-   lots of cleaned up performance and more likely to play in more mobile, browsers, and and OS combinations under the hood.

Please give it a try!

-tracey

¬†

For those of you interested in trying multiple qualities, here‚Äôs a sample video showing it:

<http://archive.org/details/kittehs>

To make that work, I made sure that my original/source file was:

-   h.264 video
-   AAC audio
-   had the ‚Äúmoov atom‚Äù at the front (to allow instant playback without waiting to download entire file first) (search web for ‚Äúqt-faststart‚Äù or ffmpeg‚Äôs ‚Äú-movflags faststart‚Äù option, or see my next post for how we make our .mp4 here at archive.org)
-   has a &gt; 480P style HD width/height
-   has filename ending with one of: ¬† .HD.mov ¬† .HD.mp4 ¬† .HD.mpeg4 ¬† ¬†.HD.m4v

When all of those are true, our system will automatically take:

-   <span style="font-size: 16px;">filename.HD.mov</span>

and create:

-   <span style="font-size: 16px;">filename.mp4</span>

that is our normal ~1000 kb/sec ‚Äúderivative‚Äù video, as well as ‚Äúfilename.ogv‚Äù

The /details/ page will then see two playable mpeg-4 h.264 videos, and offer them both with the \[HD\] toggle button (seen once video is playing) allowing users to pick between the two quality levels.

If you wanted to offer a \*third\* quality, you could do that with another ending like above but with otherwise the same requirements. ¬†So you could upload:

-   <span style="font-size: 16px;">filename.HD.mp4 ¬† ¬† ¬† (as, say, a 960 x 540 resolution video)</span>
-   <span style="font-size: 16px;">filename.HD.mpeg4 ¬† (as, say, a 1920 x 1080 resolution video)</span>

and the toggle would show the three options: ¬† 1080P, 540P, 480P

You can update existing items if you like, and re-derive your items, to get multiple qualities present.

Happy hacking!

For those video oriented of you who inspect our \_files.xml directly, or use a metadata API (JSON) for items, you‚Äôll likely be pleased to know that for all new items, as well as items that update (eg: review posted, metadata changes, rederives), that:

we now detect and stamp into each video file fields for  
width  
height  
length (duration in seconds)

here is an example file listing (in JSON results) demonstrating:  
{‚Äúname‚Äù:‚Äùanamorphic.mov‚Äù,  
‚Äúsource‚Äù:‚Äùoriginal‚Äù,  
‚Äúformat‚Äù:‚Äùh.264‚Ä≥,  
‚Äúlength‚Äù:‚Äù3.03‚Ä≥,  
‚Äúheight‚Äù:‚Äù720‚Ä≥,  
‚Äúwidth‚Äù:‚Äù1280‚Ä≥,  
‚Äúmtime‚Äù:‚Äù1355278126‚Ä≥,  
‚Äúsize‚Äù:‚Äù375646‚Ä≥,  
‚Äúmd5‚Ä≥:‚Äù94a0b479869ab7ee997b36b45d9edb7a‚Äù,  
‚Äúcrc32‚Ä≥:‚Äù0b8e4162‚Äù,  
‚Äúsha1‚Ä≥:‚Äùc21b65ee8e9153f0812d7397fe89224d6f3f80fd‚Äù}

we will even attempt to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù the width in the case of ‚Äúanamorphic‚Äù videos (eg: the pixels are ‚Äúrectangular‚Äù and not ‚Äúsquare‚Äù) to the scaled width in square pixel terms (like the one above)

cheers!

[A/V Geeks fundraiser to digitize 100 miles of film](https://blog.archive.org/2012/07/27/av-geeks-fundraiser-to-digitize-100-miles-of-film/)
============================================================================================================================================

Posted on [July 27, 2012](https://blog.archive.org/2012/07/27/av-geeks-fundraiser-to-digitize-100-miles-of-film/ "5:39 pm")<span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/wayback/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by Alexis Rossi">Alexis Rossi</a></span></span>

A/V Geeks has done a lot of digitization of old film for The Internet Archive. They are trying to raise funds to digitize many more hours of footage to put up on archive.org which will be free to view and use by the public. If you would like to contribute here is some information:

<http://www.indiegogo.com/avgeeks100miles>

WHAT? The A/V Geeks have over 24,000 old 16mm educational films that we‚Äôve rescued from landfills, dumpsters, closets, school libraries. These films cover topics from Atomic Bombs to Zoo Babies and provide an entertaining yet insightful glimpse into our past. We‚Äôve kept these materials from being thrown out and we want to continue our mission by giving them a new life and sharing them you!

Traditionally, this means that we would have to either travel to you or you would have to travel to us to watch a film on a projector. By digitizing these films we can give you and the world access to these materials! When a film from the A/V Geeks archive is digitized and uploaded to the internet, it can be easily accessed, watched, downloaded, researched and repurposed for music videos, class projects, documentaries and more.

Help us digitize 100 Miles of Film! Instead of traveling miles to give access to these films we‚Äôd rather digitize miles of 16mm film. Film length is generally measured in feet (in the US) to where 2100 feet of film roughly equals one hour of content. With your support we can digitize and make available 100 miles of film ‚Äì over 240 hours of (around 1,000 individual titles) from the archive. So we envision this as sort of a road rally. We have to go 100 miles in a short period of time. We‚Äôll have a small team to keep the machines humming along. We aren‚Äôt sure what we‚Äôll find with some of the films ‚Äì we haven‚Äôt seen them yet!

For every $500 we raise, we digitize one mile of film (nearly 2.5 hours of material)!
