<p>Posted on <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/12/15/1925-public-domain-riches/" title="9:40 pm">December 15, 2020</a><span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/wayback/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by Alexis Rossi">Alexis Rossi</a></span></span></p>
<p>On January 1st, 2021, many books, movies and other media from 1925 will enter the public domain in the United States. Some of them are quite famous — jump ahead to see lists of those <a href="#famousstuff">well known books and movies</a> that you can enjoy on the Internet Archive — or take the scenic route with me.</p>

<p>What does this all mean? Essentially, many items created in 1925 in the US that are still under copyright will become free and open for people to use in any way they see fit in the new year. But check out Duke Law’s <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2021/">Center for the Study of the Public Domain article</a> for a more in-depth explanation.</p>
<p>We have a party every year to <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/12/11/leaders-in-the-open-world-intellectual-property-and-social-justice-join-our-public-domain-day-celebration/">celebrate the new works entering the public domain</a>, and this year is no exception. Join us on Thursday, Dec. 17th to toast these newly available additions.</p>
<h2 id="traveling-from-home">Traveling from Home</h2>
<p>As part of this yearly ritual, I explore our collections to unearth these newly freed items, and I invariably run across a few things that hit a nerve. This year, it started with this intertitle in “<a href="https://archive.org/details/silent-isnt-life-terrible">Isn’t Life Terrible?</a>” Less than 20 seconds into this 1925 film, and suddenly I’m dumped back into 2020.</p>

<p>Rude, right? I don’t even have a front yard to enjoy during shelter in place.</p>
<p>But the magic of media is that it can transport us to different places and times. Photo books like <a href="https://archive.org/details/picturesqueitaly00hielrich/">Picturesque Italy</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/picturesquemexic00stau/">Picturesque Mexico</a>, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/picturesquepales00grob">Picturesque Palestine, Arabia and Syria</a> show us both how much and how little has changed in the past 95 years.</p>

<p>Gondolas still glide under the Bridge of Sighs, and the Tower of Pisa is still leaning, but the 1925 version of the Colosseum certainly lacks today’s fake gladiator photo ops.</p>
<h2 id="looking-at-the-past-with-the-eyes-of-today">Looking at the past with the eyes of today</h2>
<p>Every toe dipped into the past has the potential to surprise or shock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/storyofpantryshe00butt/">The story of a pantry shelf, an outline history of grocery specialties</a> is only mildly interesting on the surface. Essentially, it’s a sales pitch to food manufacturers encouraging them to advertise in a set of women’s magazines. The book contains short case histories of successful food brands like Maxwell House Coffee, Campbell Soup, Coca Cola, etc. (all of whom advertise with them, naturally).</p>
<p>The book gives you a glimpse of why people were so enthusiastic about mass produced, packaged foods. Unsanitary conditions, bugs in your sugar, milk going bad over night; things modern shoppers never think about.</p>
<p>It puts this glowing praise of Kraft Cheese into perspective: “…a pasteurized product, blended to obtain a uniformity of quality and flavor, a thing greatly lacking in ordinary types of cheese.” (<a href="https://archive.org/details/storyofpantryshe00butt/page/148">page 149</a>)</p>
<p>That’s pretty entertaining if you’re a cheese lover. I think most people would agree that Kraft cheese is no longer on the cutting edge.</p>
<p>But keep poking around and you find a much deeper cultural divergence. While <a href="https://archive.org/details/storyofpantryshe00butt/">The story of a pantry shelf</a> is extolling the virtues of the home economics training available at Cornell, you stumble across this horrifying sentence (<a href="https://archive.org/details/storyofpantryshe00butt/page/12/">page 12</a>).</p>

<p>I was not expecting to read about orphaned babies being used as “learning aids” while flipping through stories about Jell-O. Intellectually, I know that attitudes towards children have changed over the years — the <a href="https://archive.org/details/ERIC_ED164896">Fair Labor Standards Act</a>, which set federal standards for child labor, wasn’t even passed until 1938. But this casual aside tossed in amongst the marketing hype still packs an emotional punch. It’s important to remember how far we have come.</p>
<p>Even writing that was forward-thinking for the time, like the booklet <a href="https://archive.org/details/homosexuallife692fiel/">Homo-sexual life</a>, is terribly backward according to today’s standards. It’s from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Blue_Book">Little Blue Book</a> series — we have many that were <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=publisher%3AHaldeman-Julius&amp;&amp;and%5B%5D=year%3A%221925%22">published in 1925</a>, and the publisher was <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=publisher%3AHaldeman-Julius">quite prolific</a> for many years. The series provided working class people with inexpensive access to all kinds of topics including philosophy, sexuality, science, religion, law, and government. Post WWII, they published criticism of J. Edgar Hoover and the founder was subsequently targeted by the FBI for tax evasion. But in 1925, they were going strong and one of their prolific writers was <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=darrow+AND+publisher%3AHaldeman-Julius&amp;sort=-date">Clarence Darrow</a>.</p>
<h2 id="controversies-of-the-age">Controversies of the Age</h2>
<p>Darrow was <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=darrow+AND+Prohibition+AND+publisher%3AHaldeman-Julius&amp;sort=-date">writing about prohibition</a> for the Little Blue Book series in 1925, but that is also the year he defended John T. Scopes for teaching evolution in his Tennessee classroom. The <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=scopes+trial">Scopes Trial</a> generated a huge amount of publicity, pitting religion against science, and even giving rise to popular songs like these two 78rpm recordings from 1925.</p>

<p>Like the Scopes trial, prohibition had its passionate <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=prohibition&amp;&amp;and%5B%5D=year%3A%221925%22">adherents and detractors</a>. This was the “Roaring 20s” — the year The Great Gatsby was published — with speakeasies and flappers and iconic cocktails. And yet the pro-prohibition silent film <a href="https://archive.org/details/silent-episodes-in-the-life-of-a-gin-bottle">Episodes in the Life of a Gin Bottle</a> follows a bottle around as it lures people into a state of dissolution.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/download/silent-episodes-in-the-life-of-a-gin-bottle/Episodes%20in%20the%20Life%20of%20a%20Gin%20Bottle.mp4" class="uri">https://archive.org/download/silent-episodes-in-the-life-of-a-gin-bottle/Episodes%20in%20the%20Life%20of%20a%20Gin%20Bottle.mp4</a></p>
<p>We even see an entire <a href="https://archive.org/details/bookoforiginalpa00owen">book about throwing parties</a> that includes no alcoholic beverages at all.</p>
<h2 id="the-more-things-change-the-more-they-stay-the-same">The more things change, the more they stay the same</h2>
<p>But as much as some things have changed, other aspects of our lives remain unchanged. People still want to tell <a href="https://archive.org/details/bestdogstories00watk">you about their pets</a>, rely on <a href="https://archive.org/details/gameoflifehowtop00shin">self help books</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/enchantedpeacock00brow/">read stories</a> to their kids, follow <a href="https://archive.org/details/silent-1925-studio-tour">celebrities</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/manylaughsforman00cobb">tell each other jokes</a>, and make <a href="https://archive.org/details/silent-cockeyed-gems-from-the-memory-of-a-nutty-cameraman">silly videos</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/download/silent-cockeyed-gems-from-the-memory-of-a-nutty-cameraman/Cockeyed%3A%20Gems%20from%20the%20Memory%20of%20a%20Nutty%20Cameraman.mp4" class="uri">https://archive.org/download/silent-cockeyed-gems-from-the-memory-of-a-nutty-cameraman/Cockeyed%3A%20Gems%20from%20the%20Memory%20of%20a%20Nutty%20Cameraman.mp4</a></p>
<p>And the most unchanging part of this particular season, of course — children still anticipate the arrival of Santa Claus with questions, wishes and schemes.</p>
<p>The silent film <a href="https://archive.org/details/silent-santa-claus">Santa Claus</a> features two children who want to know where Saint Nick lives and how he spends his time. We follow him to the North Pole (Alaska in disguise) to see Santa’s workshop, snow castle, reindeer, and friends and neighbors. Jack Frost, introduced around 14:20, appears to be wearing the prototype for Ralphie’s bunny suit in “A Christmas Story” (but with a magic wand). Stick around for the sleigh crash at 20:45, and right around 22:20 Santa wipes out on the ice.</p>

<p>And just in case you’re still doing your holiday shopping, I feel like I should pass on a recommendation from this ad in a <a href="https://archive.org/details/pub_billboard?and%5B%5D=year%3A%221925%22&amp;sort=date">1925 The Billboard</a> magazine: <a href="https://archive.org/details/sim_billboard_1925-12-12_37_50/page/36/mode/2up">Armadillo Baskets</a> make beautiful Christmas gifts.

<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/details/proclamationofem12linc">Emancipation Proclamation</a> went into effect on January 1st, 1863, legally freeing 3.5 million <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%28slavery%20OR%20enslaved%20OR%20abolitionist%20OR%20antislavery%29">enslaved people</a> in the Confederate states. But of course, this executive order from <a href="https://archive.org/details/lincolncollection">President Abraham Lincoln</a> came in the midst of the <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22civil+war%22+AND+subject%3A%28American+OR+%22United+States%22%29&amp;sin=">United States Civil War</a>, which didn’t end until April of 1865 – the order could not be enforced until the war was over. </p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=title%3Ajuneteenth">Juneteenth</a> celebrates when enslaved people actually became free in 1865. The date, June 19th, commemorates <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=%22gordon%20granger%22">General Gordon Granger</a> of the Union Army announcing the executive order in Galveston, Texas, freeing all enslaved people in Texas.</p>
<p>Community access TV stations around the country have shown <a href="https://archive.org/details/community_media?and%5B%5D=juneteenth">local celebrations of Juneteenth</a> for years, and we thought this 2013 talk by Dr. Shennette Garrett-Scott at the Allen Public Library in Texas (via <a href="https://archive.org/details/coatx">Allen City TV</a>) was particularly helpful in understanding the history of this important day.</p>

<p>You could listen to multiple people recite the <a href="https://archive.org/details/pi_0803_librivox">first 50 digits of pi in various styles</a>, including to the tune of the Battle Hymn of the Republic (my personal favorite), in the voice of Bullwinkle, as an infomercial, in Latin, while laughing, in Morse Code, and while eating actual pie.</p>

<p>Commercial radio broadcasting began in the 1920s, bringing entertainment, news and music into people’s homes. Now, instead of needing to play a 78rpm disc on your phonograph, you could just tune in to listen to popular songs.</p>
<p>And in 1923 that means you would have been listening to one of the many versions of “<a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=title%3A%22yes%20we%20have%20no%20bananas%22&amp;and%5B%5D=year%3A%221923%22">Yes!

<p>You could listen to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/78_yes-we-have-no-bananas_billy-jones-silver-cohn_gbia0010572a">Billy Jones</a> version (play below), the <a href="https://archive.org/details/78_yes-we-have-no-bananas-si-se-acabaron-los-platanos_the-great-white-way-orchestr_gbia0038795a">Billy Murray</a> version, a <a href="https://archive.org/details/78_ye-chon-ni-kein-panenis-yes-we-have-no-bananas_gus-goldstein-frank-silver-irvin_gbia0051711a">Yiddish</a> version, or an <a href="https://archive.org/details/78_yes-we-have-no-bananas_eduardo-migliaccio-farfariello-e-migliaccion-irving-coha_gbia0051733a">Italian</a> version, among others.</p>

<p>Then you could have moved on to dancing the <a href="https://archive.org/details/78_charleston_les-elgart-and-his-orchestra-c-mack-j-johnson_gbia0086920b">Charleston</a>, popularized by the song of the same name from the 1923 musical “Runnin’ Wild.”   And with the explosion of recordings by African American musicians, you could also enjoy “<a href="https://archive.org/details/78_baby-wont-you-please-come-home-blues_bessie-smith-clarence-williams-warfield-and-w_gbia0039319a">Baby Won’t You Please Come Home</a>” by <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Bessie+Smith%22&amp;sort=date">Bessie Smith</a> and “<a href="https://archive.org/details/78_dipper-mouth-blues_joe-oliver-armstrong-oliver-louis-armstrong-johnny-dodds-honore_gbia0001054b">Dipper Mouth Blues</a>” by <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Louis+Armstrong%22&amp;sort=date">Louis Armstrong</a>.</p>

<p>But why are we focusing on 1923? Because for the first time in 20 years, new works are entering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a> in the United States (read more: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/02/the-drought-is-over-mass-us-copyright-expiry-brings-flood-of-works-into-public-domain?fbclid=IwAR0XcvzFcDQG0kV3N6Fjnd5NhiyM7U7mjVMQhDLvbBGPFhiRUpNEliyHhKc">1,</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/books/copyright-extension-literature-public-domain.html">2</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/12/30/680994544/on-jan-1-books-movies-and-music-from-1923-enter-public-domain">3)</a>. And those works were all published in, you guessed it, 1923.</p>
<p>Settle in with a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup, a Butterfinger, or a refreshing Popsicle (all invented in 1923!) while you watch Cecil B.

<p>Posted on <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2017/12/30/30-days-of-stuff/" title="6:34 pm">December 30, 2017</a><span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/jasonscott/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by Jason Scott">Jason Scott</a></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/301.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/301-253x300.jpg" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-15675" sizes="(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/301-253x300.jpg 253w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/301-768x910.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/301-864x1024.jpg 864w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/301.jpg 1365w" width="253" height="300" /></a>Jason Scott, free-range archivist, reporting in as 2017 draws to a close.</p>
<p>As part of our end-of-year fundraising drive, I thought it might be fun to tweet highlighted parts of the vast stacks of content that the Internet Archive makes available for free to millions. A lot of folks know about our <a href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> and its 20+ years of website history, but there’s petabytes of media and works available to see throughout the site. I called it “30 Days of Stuff”, and for the last 30 days I’ve been pointing out great items at the Archive, once a day.</p>
<p>You won’t have to swim upstream through my tweets; here on the last day, I’ve compiled the highlighted items in this entry. Enjoy these jewels in the Archive’s collection, a small sample of the wide range of items we provide.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303-199x300.jpg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15676" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303-199x300.jpg 199w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303-678x1024.jpg 678w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303.jpg 720w" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Books and Texts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.org/details/thelatchkey01millarch">The Latch Key of my Bookhouse</a> was one of the first books scanned by the Internet Archive in its book scanner tests, and it’s a 1921 directory of Children’s Literature that is filled with really nice illustrations that came out great.</li>
<li>As part of our ever-growing set of Defense Technical Information Center collection, we have <a href="https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA055327">The Role of the Citizens Band Radio Service and Travelers Information Stations In Civil Preparedness Emergencies Final Report</a>, a 1978 overview of CB Radio and what role it might play in civil emergencies. Many thousands of taxpayer-funded educational and defense items are mirrored in this collection.</li>
<li>Also in the DTIC collection is <a href="https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA095145">The Battalion Commander’s Handbook 1980</a>, which besides the crazy front page of stamps, approvals and sign-offs, is basically a manager’s handbook written from the point of view of the US Army.</li>
<li>There are <a href="https://archive.org/details/tractormanuals">hundreds of tractor manuals</a> at the Archive. Hundreds! Of all types, languages (a lot of them Russian) and level of information. Tractors are one of those tools that can last generations and keeping the maintenance on them in the field can make a huge difference in livelihood.</li>
<li>A lovely 1904 catalog for plums called <a href="https://archive.org/details/CAT31286852">The Maynard Plum Catalogue</a> was scanned in with one of our partner organizations and it’s a breathless and inspiring declaration of the future wonder of the plums this wizard of plum-growing, Luther Burbank, was bringing to the world.</li>
<li>Xerox Corporation released “<a href="https://archive.org/details/TNM_Coloring_Book_A_metamorphosis_of_creative_cop_20170922_0699">A Metamorphosis of Creative Copying</a>” in 1964, which seems to function as both promotion for Xerox and a weird gift to give to your kids to color in.</li>
<li>In 2014, a short zine called <a href="https://archive.org/details/TaoOfBitcoinIssue1">The Tao of Bitcoin</a> was released, telling people the dream of $10,000 bitcoin would be real.</li>
<li>The 1888 chapbook <a href="https://archive.org/details/goodytwoshoes00newyiala">Goody Two-Shoes</a> has lovely illustrations, and a fine short story.</li>
<li>Working with a lovely couple who brought in a <a href="https://archive.org/details/The_Official_Negro_Directory_and_Classified_Buyers_Guide_1942-1943">1942 black-owned-businesses directory</a>, I scanned the pages by hand and put them up into this item.</li>
<li>Inside that directory was an ad for a school of whistling that said it taught using the methods of Agnes Woodward, and a quick scan of the Archive’s stacks showed that we had an entire copy of her book <a href="https://archive.org/details/WhistlingAsAnArt">Whistling as an Art</a>!</li>
<li>The medical treatise <a href="https://archive.org/details/sleepitsderangem00hamm">Sleep and Its Derangements</a>, from 1869, is William A. Hammond, MD’s overview of sleep, and what can go wrong. Scanned from the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine, it’s one of many thousands of books we’ve scanned with partners.</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.org/details/lethartmanfeathe00hart">Let Hartman Feather Your Nest</a> could be described as “A furniture catalog” in the same way the Sistine Chapel could be described as “a place of worship”. The catalog is a thundering, fist-pounding declaration of the superiority of the Hartman enterprise and the quality and breadth of furniture and service that will arrive at your door and be backed up to the far reaches of time.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/302.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/302-229x300.jpg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15677" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/302-229x300.jpg 229w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/302.jpg 602w" width="229" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Magazines</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Photoplay considered itself <em>the</em> magazine for the motion picture industry in the first part of the 20th century, and this <a href="https://archive.org/details/phodec21chic">multi-volume compilation</a> of photos, articles and advertisements is a truly lovely overview.</li>
<li>There’s over <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=maximum%20collection%3Azines">140 issues of the classic Maximum RockNRoll zine</a>, truly the king of music zines for a very long time. On its newsprint pages are howls and screeches of all manner of punk, rock and the needs of musicians.</li>
<li>A magazine created by the Walt Disney Company to trumpet various parts of Disneyland and its attractions was called Vacationland, and this <a href="https://archive.org/details/VacationlandFall1965">Fall 1965 issue</a> covers all sorts of stuff about the park’s first decade.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/304.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/304-300x204.jpg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15678" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/304-300x204.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/304.jpg 574w" width="300" height="204" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Movies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rescued from a warehouse years ago, a collection of Hollywood movie “B-Roll”, unused secondary scenes often filmed by different crew, has been digitized. My personal favorite is <a href="https://archive.org/details/PET1034_R-4">[Western Film Scenes]</a>, which is circa 1950s footage of a Western Town, all of it utterly fake but feeling weirdly real, to be used in a western. Don’t miss everyone standing around looking right at you and looking like they agree quite energetically with you!</li>
<li>No compilation could be complete without the legendary <a href="https://archive.org/details/DuckandC1951">Duck and Cover</a>, a cartoon/PSA that explained the simple ways to avoid injury in a nuclear blast. Just lie down! It’ll be fine. Please note: This Probably Won’t Work. But the song is very catchy.</li>
<li>The very weird <a href="https://archive.org/details/The_Electric-Film_Format_Acid_Test_1990">Electric Film Format Acid Test</a> from 1990 has a semi-interested model holding up a color bar plate in a wide, wide variety of film and video formats. Filmed just a few blocks away from the Internet Archive’s current headquarters.</li>
<li>I snuck in a <a href="https://archive.org/details/brewster_kahle_interview_1992">1992 interview with the Archive’s founder, Brewster Kahle</a>, back when he was 33 and working at WAIS, a company or two before the Archive and where he is asked about his thoughts on information and gathering of data. It’s quite interesting to hear the consistency of thought.</li>
<li>The Office of War Information worked with Disney to create “<a href="https://archive.org/details/DentalHealth1945">Dental Health</a>“, a film to show to troops about proper dental care. It’s a combination of straightforward animation and industrial film-making worth enjoying.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1-300x300.jpg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15679" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1-768x765.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1-1024x1020.jpg 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/261-1.jpg 1142w" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Audio</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have a collection of hours of the radio show <a href="https://archive.org/details/RkoOrsonWelles-TheShadow-RadioRecodings">The Shadow</a> from 1938-1939, starring  Orson Welles at 23, at the height of his performance powers, playing the dual main role.</li>
<li>For Christmas Eve, we pointed to <a href="https://archive.org/details/78_christmas-chopsticks-twas-the-night-before-christmas_fred-heider-bobby-burns-pet_gbia0000281b">“Christmas Chopsticks”</a>, a 1953 78rpm record of “Twas the Night Before Christmas” performed to the tune of the classic piano piece “Chopsticks”; one of tens of thousands of 78rpm records the Archive has been adding this year.</li>
<li>On Christmas, a user of the Archive uploaded two obscure albums he’d purchased on eBay – remnants of the S. S. Kresge Company, which became K-Mart, and which were played over the PA system for shoppers. He got his hands on Albums <a href="https://archive.org/details/S.S.KresgeChristmasBackgroundMusicNo.261">#261</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/S.S.KresgeChristmasBackgroundMusicNo.294">#294</a>.</li>
<li>Earlier in the month before the user uploaded those Christmas albums, I linked to a different holiday collection of K-Mart items, a <a href="https://archive.org/details/KmartDecember1974ReelToReel">1974 Reel-to-Reel</a> that started with a K-Mart jingle and went full holiday from there.</li>
<li>Before he was a (retired) talk show host, and before he was a stand-up comedian, David Letterman worked and trained in radio. Happily, we have <a href="https://archive.org/details/DavidLetterman-WagoBallStateUniversityMuncie-TuesdayApril11969">recordings of Dave Letterman</a>, DJ, from when he was 22, at Ball State University.</li>
<li>Ron “Boogiemonster” Gerber has been hosting his weekly pop music recycling radio show, “Crap from the Past”, for over 25 years, and he’s been uploading and cataloging his show to the Archive for well over 10 of those years, including all the way back to the beginning of his show. The full <a href="https://archive.org/details/crapfromthepast">Crap From The Past</a> archive is up and is hundreds of hours of fun.</li>
<li>The truly weird “<a href="https://archive.org/details/conquer-videogame-craze-album/">Conquer the Video Craze</a>” is a 1982 record album with straightforward descriptions of how to beat games like Centipede, Defender, Stargate, Dig Dug, and more. This album has been sampled from by multiple DJs to bring that extra spice to a track.</li>
<li>Over 3,000 shows at the DNA Lounge are at the archive, including “<a href="https://archive.org/details/DNALOUNGE-2015-03-07">Bootie: Gamer Night</a>“, which combines mash-up tracks and video games. Bootie has been playing at DNA Lounge for years, and puts the audio from one song with the singing from another, and… it’s quite addicting, like games. This night was for the nearby Game Developers’ Conference being held the same week.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/videocraze-800.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/videocraze-800-286x300.jpg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15680" sizes="(max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/videocraze-800-286x300.jpg 286w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/videocraze-800.jpg 763w" width="286" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Software</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2011, as part of a “retrocomputing” competition, we saw the release of “Paku-Paku”, a pac-clone program which ran in an obscure early PC-Compatible graphics mode that was <em>very</em> colorful and <em>very </em>small (160×100) and was built perfectly for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Paku_Paku_2011">You can play the game in your browser by clicking here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.org/details/mac_Psion_Chess">Psion Chess</a> is a game for the Macintosh that can play both you and itself with pretty high levels of skill and really sharp and crisp black and white graphics.  It makes a really great screensaver in self-playing mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>People often overuse a phrase like “Barely scratched the surface”, but I assure you there are millions of amazing items in the archive, and it’s been a pleasure to bring some to light. While the 30 Days of Stuff was a fun way to stretch out a month of fundraising with stuff to see every day, we’re here 24/7 to bring you all these items, and welcome you finding jewels, gems and clunkers throughout our hard drives whenever you want.</p>
<p>Thanks for another year!</p>

<h1 id="the-internet-arcade-becomes-an-archive-reality"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/2016/11/17/the-internet-arcade-becomes-a-archive-reality/">The Internet Arcade becomes an Archive Reality</a></h1>
<p>Posted on <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2016/11/17/the-internet-arcade-becomes-a-archive-reality/" title="4:20 am">November 17, 2016</a><span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/jasonscott/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by Jason Scott">Jason Scott</a></span></span></p>
<p>A couple years back, we introduced the <a href="https://archive.org/details/internetarcade">Internet Arcade</a>, which enabled people around the world to play a number of Arcade titles from the last 40 years in their browsers, instantly. We’ve also had collections of <a href="https://archive.org/details/consolelivingroom">console games</a>, and a <a href="https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary">general library of tens of thousands of software programs</a> which has also proven very popular.</p>
<p>The work continues to expand the emulated systems and refresh what titles are available, but a project we’ve had going on the side for a while just came to fruition.</p>
<p>Among the organizations that turned out to benefit from having our browser-based emulations was <a href="https://shop.xgaming.com/">X-Arcade</a>, manufacturers of high-quality joysticks and control panels for use with computers and software. Meant to have the original Arcade feel, a few examples of these controllers were gifted to the Archive and we’ve used them pretty extensively in demonstration days and special events.</p>
<p>Last year, X-Arcade announced an old-school full-sized arcade machine case for sale, and generously offered to send one to the Archive as well. We contacted an excellent artist, Mar Williams of <a href="http://www.sudux.com">Sudux.com</a>, who has done excellent art for the DEFCON hacking conference and many other events, and she put together custom Internet Archive-themed arcade side art for the machine. Here’s what she came up with:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ia-mockup.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ia-mockup.jpg" alt="ia-mockup" class="wp-image-12165 aligncenter" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ia-mockup.jpg 671w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ia-mockup-198x300.jpg 198w" width="430" height="653" /></a></p>
<p>The machine has made its way through shipping and moving companies and arrived at the Internet Archive’s 300 Funston Avenue headquarters in great shape, along with all the electronics and parts to make it go soon.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to see a mockup, and another to see the actual machine in your lobby:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2662.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2662.jpg" alt="img_2662" class="wp-image-12166 aligncenter" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2662.jpg 2448w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2662-225x300.jpg 225w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2662-768x1024.jpg 768w" width="578" height="770" /></a></p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, the system will be set up to run with the Internet Archive systems and provide a really nice demonstration station for the many guests and visitors we see. It really jazzes up the place!</p>
<p>In the meantime, we’re now <a href="https://archive.org/details/Internet_Arcade_Machine_Artwork">providing you with links to download the artwork files</a>, in case you want to use them yourself.</p>
<p>Thanks again to <a href="https://shop.xgaming.com/">X-Arcade</a> for the lovely addition to our lobby, and to <a href="http://sudux.com">Mar Williams</a> for such fantastic art!</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2016/04/20/truck-and-back-again-the-internet-archive-truck-takes-a-detour/" title="3:01 pm">April 20, 2016</a><span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/jasonscott/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by Jason Scott">Jason Scott</a></span></span></p>
<p>When one of our employees came out of his home over the weekend, he saw an empty parking space. Granted, in San Francisco, that’s a pretty precious thing, but since this empty parking space had held the Internet Archive Truck for the previous two days, he was not feeling particularly lucky.</p>
<p>A staff conversation then ensued, the city was called to see if the truck had been towed, and after a short time, it became obvious that no, somebody had stolen the Truck.</p>
<p>This in itself is not news: thousands of vehicles are stolen in the Bay Area every year. But what makes this unusual was the nature of the vehicle stolen… the Truck is a pretty unique looking vehicle.</p>

<p>Once the report was filed with the police and a few more checks were made to ensure that the truck was absolutely, positively missing and presumed stolen, the truck’s theft was <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/722094405931397121">announced on Twitter</a>, which garnered tens of thousands of views and the news being spread very far. Thanks to everyone who got the word out.</p>
<p>What was not expected, besides the initial theft, was that a lot of people wondered why the Internet Archive, essentially a website, would have a truck. So, here’s a little bit about why.</p>
<p>Besides the providing of <a href="http://web.textfiles.com">older websites</a>, <a href="http://www.openlibrary.org">books</a>, <a href="http://archive.org/details/movies">movies</a>, <a href="http://archive.org/details/audio">music</a>, <a href="http://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary">software</a> and other materials to millions of visitors a day, the Internet Archive also has buildings for physical storage located in Richmond, just outside the limits of San Francisco. In these buildings, we hold copies of books we’ve scanned, audio recordings, software boxes, films, and a variety of other materials that we are either turning digital or holding for the future. It turns out you can’t be a 100% online experience – physical life just gets in the way. We also have multiple data centers and the need to transport equipment between them.</p>
<p>Therefore, we’ve had a hard-working vehicle for getting these materials around: a 2003 GMC Savana Cutaway G3500, often parked out front of the Archive’s 300 Funston Avenue address and making up to several trips a week between our various locations.</p>
<p>In a touch of whimsy, the truck has had a unique paint job for most of its life with the Archive. Notably, this isn’t even the first mural it had on its sides; here is a shot with the previous mural:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10620121_10152811702463834_2063151320571234802_o.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10620121_10152811702463834_2063151320571234802_o.jpg" alt="10620121_10152811702463834_2063151320571234802_o" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10953" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10620121_10152811702463834_2063151320571234802_o.jpg 2048w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10620121_10152811702463834_2063151320571234802_o-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10620121_10152811702463834_2063151320571234802_o-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10620121_10152811702463834_2063151320571234802_o-1024x683.jpg 1024w" width="2048" height="1365" /></a></p>
<p>We’re not sure of the motivation in stealing this rather unique and noticeable vehicle, and there seems to be some evidence it was driven around the city for a while after it was taken. But yesterday, we were contacted by the San Francisco Police Department with really great news:</p>
<p><strong>The Truck has been recovered!</strong></p>
<p>Left abandoned by the side of the road, the truck was found and is about to be returned to the Archive, and with good luck, back and in service helping us prepare and transport materials related to our mission: to bring the world’s knowledge to everyone.</p>
<p>Again, thanks to everyone who sounded out the original call for the truck’s return, and to the SFPD for getting a hold of the truck so quickly after it was gone.</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2015/12/28/the-internet-archive-telethon-pt-3/" title="11:47 pm">December 28, 2015</a><span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/jasonscott/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by Jason Scott">Jason Scott</a></span></span></p>
<p><em>See also Parts <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2015/12/26/the-internet-archive-telethon-pt-1/">1</a> and <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2015/12/27/the-internet-archive-telethon-pt-2/">2</a>.</em></p>
<p>We dreamed up the idea of an Internet Archive Telethon, and due to the work of employees, volunteers, and performers, we put together an (almost) 24-hour show. We had an amazing time doing it.</p>
<p>But what were the results?</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/yay.png"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/yay.png" alt="yay" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10492" sizes="(max-width: 1305px) 100vw, 1305px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/yay.png 1305w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/yay-300x172.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/yay-768x441.png 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/yay-1024x589.png 1024w" width="1305" height="750" /></a></p>
<p>In total, including the 2-1 matching grant we had going on, we raised <strong>$131,134</strong> across the 24 hour telethon period. Many donations were $50 or $100, with some lower and a few higher. Watching the funding trends that were in effect from the previous year and this month, there was roughly <em>$30,000</em> expected to be made if we hadn’t done anything unusual beyond the fundraising banner and the usual contacting of folks to donate. So that means, unscientifically, that the Internet Archive Telethon caused a <em>400 percent increase in donations</em>, which makes it a wild success!</p>
<p>A shout-out to Doug Kaye of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130729200341id_/http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/">IT Conversations</a>, who donated $10,000 to the event towards the end, as well as Kevin Savetz, who contributed $1,500 in the name of the vintage computing history he and others have been uploading. Limor Fried of Adafruit donated $500, and many, many others contributed other amounts throughout the day and night.</p>
<p>Not only was money raised, but awareness was raised: people were being told about the show and were checking out the Internet Archive for the first time. We got a chance to see everyone excited and happy at the end of the year about this place we work in, and to talk about what brings us there. And the performance acts, all volunteering time and effort, provided us with amazing entertainment and spectacle. It was a resounding success on many other levels as well.</p>
<p>Will it happen again next year? Who knows. What we do know is how incredibly wonderful the experience was, even through all the hard work and intense effort, and how great it is that a mission like the Archive’s can inspire so much.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for being a part of this.</p>
<p><em>There are so many people to thank for this event. We’ll start with <a href="http://www.eddie.com">Eddie Codel</a> for livestreaming equipment and Jasmine/Chris/Alex at <a href="http://www.supportclass.net/">Support Class</a> for their on-screen reactive graphics – you all made us seem much more professional. On the internal side of Internet Archive employees, June Goldsmith handled administration concerns with the hosting of the event and worked out logistics. The front office (Katherine, Laurel and Michelle) made the calls and the reaching out for security, scheduling and logistics. Michelle invited many of our acts and made logistical arrangements for their media, as well as recruited and organized our team of non-staff volunteers. Wendy Hanamura provided advice, booking, and contacts for multiple acts, as well as being onsite for portions of the event.  A lot of employees and volunteers came onsite to help run the Cortex, including Sam, Davide, Jake, Kevin, Laurel, Trevor, Jackie, Carolyn, and Jeff. Rachel Lovinger was a tireless producer for the majority of the cortex’s existence. Carolyn did the Telethon landing page graphics and web design. Will Fitzgerald provided coding for the banner linkage as well as a major assist to near-realtime automatic updating of telethon fundraising totals. Ralf, Tracey, Tim, Trevor, and Brewster and others helped during the Great Network Confusion of December 2015, getting the entire network infrastructure whipped into shape. And, of course, our many acts, including Conspiracy of Beards, Diva Marisa Lendhart, Craig Baldwin, Andy Isaacson, Chris Gray, Justin Hall, Lauren Taylor, Jeff Kaplan, Odd Salon, Gary Gach, Trevor von Stein, the Balkan Brass Band, Alexis Rossi and Dwalu Khasu, Rick and Megan Prelinger, John Perry Barlow and John Gilmore, John Law.</em></p>
<p><em>We are no doubt missing many more people who contributed to the Telethon both behind and in front of the camera –  it’s a testimony to how many hands came forward to lift this dream up into reality. Thanks to everyone who was a part of it.</em></p>

<p>Posted on <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2015/10/18/a-treasure-trove-of-adventure-and-uploading/" title="12:29 pm">October 18, 2015</a><span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/jasonscott/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by Jason Scott">Jason Scott</a></span></span></p>
<p>The Internet Archive opens its doors and drives towards a goal of <em>Universal Access to Knowledge</em>, and encourages contributions and uploads from our audience on a global scale. In some cases, like our <a href="https://archive.org/details/netlabels">Netlabels</a> section, the contributors are often the creators as well, publishing open-licensed music at the Archive. Others, however, are doing their part to make sure near-forgotten works find a new life online.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/RM_Ballantyne_The_Pirate_City"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RM_Ballantyne_The_Pirate_City_0006.jpg" alt="RM_Ballantyne_The_Pirate_City_0006" class="wp-image-9959 alignright" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RM_Ballantyne_The_Pirate_City_0006.jpg 542w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RM_Ballantyne_The_Pirate_City_0006-184x300.jpg 184w" width="341" height="557" /></a> Shining among these contributing curators is one <a href="https://archive.org/details/@nick_hodson">Nick Hodson</a> of Athelstane e-books, who over the course of years uploaded hundreds (more that 400, in fact) of late 19th century stories of adventure. These books, created by a wide range of authors and publishing houses, contain all manner of plot, drama and intrigue, as well as some top-quality illustration work of the time.</p>
<p>With titles like <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/Kingston_Twice_Lost">Twice Lost</a> </em>(1876), <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/Richard_Archer_The_Island_Home">The Island Home or The Adventures of Six Young Crusoes</a></em> (1851), <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/WHG_Kingston_Ranger_and_Crusader">The Voyages of the Ranger and Crusader and What Befell Their Passengers and Crews</a></em> (1872) and <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/GM_Fenn_Cutlass_and_Cudgel">Cutlass and Cudgel</a></em> (1890), these writings range from epic stories to tales for young readers, a gamut worth traveling in itself.</p>
<p>Additionally, historical work has been done to give context to the books, including biographies of the authors and publishing houses. Explanations of the process of converting the items have been included as well, revealing that Hodson and his colleagues would set up voice synthesizers reading the text, to catch any errors not found other ways.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/RM_Ballantyne_The_Pirate_City"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RM_Ballantyne_The_Pirate_City_0010.jpg" alt="RM_Ballantyne_The_Pirate_City_0010" class="alignleft wp-image-9960" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RM_Ballantyne_The_Pirate_City_0010.jpg 579w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RM_Ballantyne_The_Pirate_City_0010-196x300.jpg 196w" width="318" height="486" /></a></p>
<p>It’s good enough to bring to the spotlight this collection of literature, and to point out that as a library, it’s a handsome snapshot of a writing style of the past. But beyond that is the fact that the Archive’s digital storehouses are most welcoming to contributors who accompany the files with the descriptions and reasons behind their being added to the collections.</p>
<p>When a reader finds these stories, now over a century and a half in the past, they do so looking for the descriptions, titles and other information attached to them by the uploader. The reward comes in the view counts and reviews from a happy audience stumbling on a trove of writing that references lives long past.</p>
<p>The Internet Archive’s <a href="https://archive.org/upload/">upload facility</a> awaits quality contributions of culture and history from throughout the world, and continual improvements in search, browsing and on-line reading mean the reward for your efforts will be an ever-growing and grateful audience.</p>
<p>Here’s to the adventures on the high seas, and the adventures of contributors to the Internet Archive, past and future!</p>
