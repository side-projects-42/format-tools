The idea is that if you’re curious enough to want to know something, that you can get access to that information. That was the promise of the printing press or Andrew Carnegie’s public libraries — fueling so much citizenship and democracy in the United States. The Internet was the opportunity to really make this dream come true.

What we have is an opportunity that happens maybe only once a millennium. The opportunity that  comes only when we change how knowledge is recorded and shared. From oral to manuscript, manuscript to printing, and now from printing to digital. I was lucky enough to be there in 1980 and thought: *what a fantastic opportunity to try to influence that transition.*

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Memex.png" alt="From Life magazine, Volume 19, Number 11, Sept 10, 1945" class="wp-image-23561" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Memex.png 627w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Memex-300x269.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Memex-624x559.png 624w" width="429" height="384" /><figcaption>From <em><a href="https://books.google.ru/books?id=uUkEAAAAMBAJ">Life</a></em> magazine, Volume 19, Number 11, Sept 10, 1945</figcaption></figure>

Of course, we were building on the vision of many before us. This dream of having an interlocking publishing system had been around for a long time. Vannevar Bush’s 1945 article “As We May Think” was very much on people’s minds in the 1980s. There was Ted Nelson’s Xanadu—a world of hypertext. Doug Engelbart’s way of annotating and enabling you to build on the works of others.

The key thing was not the computers. Actually, it was the network. It was the ability to communicate with each other. Sure, anybody could go and write word processing documents. That’s good. But can you make everybody a publisher? Can everyone find their voice and their community no matter where they are in the world? And can people write in a way that allows others to build on their work? By 1996, we had built that. It was the World Wide Web.

With this global publishing network, the Web, we could finally build the library. It was *time* to build the library. In 1996, I thought: *Why don’t we just build this thing? I mean, how hard could it be? Sure, maybe we’re going to have to go and digitize a whole library, but that couldn’t be that hard, right?*

And so, a group of us said, let’s do this. We started by archiving the most transient of media, which was the World Wide Web’s pages. We did that for five years before we even made the Wayback Machine. The idea was to record what people were publishing and be able to go and use that in new and different ways. Could we build a library to preserve all of that material, but then add computers to the mix, so that something new and magic happens?  Could we connect people, connect ideas, build on each other’s concepts with computers and these new AI things that we knew were coming. Ultimately could we make the world smarter?

Could we make people smarter by being better connected? Not just because they could read what other people were writing, but because machines would help filter information, scan vast amounts of knowledge, emphasize what is most important, provide context to the deluge.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2016-1-1024x683.jpg" class="wp-image-23565" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2016-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2016-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2016-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2016-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2016-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2016-1-624x416.jpg 624w" width="387" height="257" /></figure>

In many ways, we have achieved this, but not completely enough: now people are writing and sharing knowledge, but it is intermingled with misinformation — purposefully false information.  We still don’t have the tools to filter out the lies, and in many ways, we have business models that prosper when misinformation is widely shared. So while the dream of access may be at hand, we lack the tools and responsible organizations to help us make good use of the flood of data now at our fingertips. Given how new our digital transition is, this may not be that surprising, but it is an urgent issue that faces us. We need to fight misinformation and build data-mining tools to leverage all this knowledge to help people make better decisions — to be smarter.  

This is our challenge for our next 25 years.

When we started the Internet Archive, I felt this project needed to be done in the open and as a non-profit. We needed to have not just one or two search engines, we needed lots and lots of different organizations building their new ideas on top of the whole knowledge base of humanity. We could help by being a library for this new digital world.

It may be that most people will just feed on what they can access for free, placed there because it’s promoted by somebody. If we don’t solve this–getting quality published material to the internet population–we’re going to bring up a generation educated on whatever dreck they can find online. So we have to build not only universal access to lots of webpages, but access to the right and best information– Universal Access to All Knowledge. That is going to require requiring changes to existing  business models and adjustments by long standing institutions. We need an Internet with many winners. If we have an Internet with just a few winners, some big corporations and large governments that are controlling too much of what’s online, then we will all lose.

A library alone can not solve all of these issues, but it is a necessary component, needed infrastructure in a digital world.

Crucially, the Internet Archive has been supported by hundreds of organizations. About 800 libraries have helped build the web collections that are in the Wayback Machine. Over 1000 libraries have contributed books to be digitized into the collections—now 5 million volumes strong. And beyond that, people with expertise in, say, railway timetables, Old Time Radio, 78 RPM records—they’ve been donating physical media and uploading digital files to our servers that you see here in this room. Last year, well over 100 million people used the resources of the Internet Archive, and over 100,000 people made a financial donation to support us.  This has truly been a global project– the people’s library.

I love the weird and wacky stuff of the Internet, just the fun and frolicy things. You go online and see these things like, wow, that’s remarkable.

Yesterday, I was looking through the uploads from Kevin Hubler. He donated the collection his father built over his lifetime.  His father collected everything a particular singer, Buddy Clark, had ever done. Clark was a 1940’s big band singer who died when he was 37.  So I could listen to records, see sheet music, and dive into details, all thanks to Kevin Hubler.  I love this– going down rabbit holes and learning something deeply.  This was a tribute to Buddy Clark, but also to Kevin and his father– who prepared and preserved something they loved for the future.

That we’re able to enjoy each other and to express our wackiness– that’s the win of the World Wide Web!  That’s the thing that you wouldn’t get if it were all just more channels of television.  Yes, the internet and the World Wide Web are a bit of the Wild West, but would you want it any other way?  Isn’t that where the fun and interesting things come from?

Today, it is still the people’s internet. That’s the internet that I wanted to support by starting the Internet Archive. The World Wide Web is an experiment in radical sharing where people feel that they’re better off, not worse off, building on other people’s works. 

I’m hopeful and optimistic that we can build this next 25 years to be as interesting and fun as the last. That we can usher in another level of technology, another 25 years of blossoming, interesting ideas.

I want to  end this talk with a personal story– my grandfather Douglas Lurton was a publisher and an author who died before I was born. Last weekend I searched for his name using full text search in the 20 million texts now on the Archive and found this quotation from him in a newspaper from West Sacramento: “Take the tools in hand and carve your own best life.” — [Douglas Lurton](https://archive.org/details/cawsahs_000518/page/7/mode/1up?q=%22Take+the+tools+in+hand+and+carve+your+own+best+life%22)

Now, I would like to extend my grandfather’s advice.  “Let us all  take our tools in hand, and together, carve our own best future.”

Let’s keep the trust.

As part of the Internet Archive’s 25th Anniversary celebration we asked artist [LaTurbo Avedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTurbo_Avedon) to contemplate what the year 2046 and the future of the internet might look like through the lens of their own art practice.

LaTurbo Avedon introduces the work *Hypertext Wishes*, inviting viewers to follow a virtual token as it passes into a contemplative well of the Internet. Avedon has spent the past decade developing a body of work that illuminates the ever-growing intensity between users and virtual experiences, pursuing creative environments that deepen the meaning of memories found in the metaverse. They curate and design Panther Modern, a file-based exhibition space that encourages artists to create site-specific installations for the Internet.

Here is a clip from *Hypertext Wishes*, available for viewing at Internet Archive Headquarters:

The imagery from Hypertext Wishes is made available on the Internet Archive here: <https://archive.org/details/15_20211020_20211020_1907>

**LaTurbo Avedon** is an avatar and artist, creating work that emphasizes the practice of non-physical identity and authorship. Their process of character creation continues through gaming, performance and exhibitions. Their work has appeared internationally, including  The Whitney Museum (New York City). The Manchester International Festival (UK), Transmediale (Berlin), Haus der elektronischen Künste (Basel), HMVK (Dortmund), Barbican Center (London), Galeries Lafayette (Paris), and TRANSFER Gallery (New York).

As part of the Internet Archive’s 25th Anniversary celebration we asked artist [Olia Lialina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olia_Lialina) to contemplate what the year 2046 and the future of the internet might look like through the lens of her own art practice.

Olia Lialina’s artwork *Perpetual Calendar* builds upon the rich digital folklore tradition to start a day on your social network by wishing each other a good one in the form of an image, often animated, and most likely glittering. With <https://haveagood.today/> you can go to the future and the past, checking what day of the week were you born, or on what day of the week New Year eve 2071 is going to be. At the same time you can see it as a flipping through of her archived collection of the graphics that represent an important layer of [vernacular web](http://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/). In the beginning of the century the tradition to wish a good (nice, great, sexy,…) Monday (Tuesday, Humpday,…) with a self made or found graphic replaced “Welcome to My Home Page” greetings and relieved the ever growing urge for updates.

</figcaption></figure>**Olia Lialina** (b. 1971, Moscow) is among the best-known participants in the net.art scene of the 1990s – an early-days, network-based art pioneer. Her early work had a great impact on recognizing the Internet as a medium for artistic expression and storytelling. This century, her continuous and close attention to Internet architecture, ‘net.language’ and Web vernacular – in both artistic and publishing projects – has made her an important voice in contemporary art and new media theory. Lialina is a co-author of Digital Folklore Reader and keeper of One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age archive (together with Dragan ESpenschied). She is an Animated GIF model and professor for Art and Design Online at Merz Akademie in Stuttgart, Germany.

*The September 2021 DWeb Meetup explored the potential and reality of decentralized storage with two projects leading the way toward storing highly valuable cultural data at scale.*

*Watch the recording of the event and learn more about the speakers below.*

The September 2021 DWeb meetup was held virtually on Tuesday, September 28, 2021 at 10am PT, optimized for American/European time zones. Wendy Hanamura welcomed attendees and kicked off the meetup. Brewster Kahle, the founder of the Internet Archive, set the stage for the discussion by emphasising the need for a more secure and decentralized web. The Meetup also broached the possibility of a DWeb camp in the Fall of 2022.

The discussion explained the differences between the IPFS and Filecoin systems, how they work together and delved into the two projects led by Arkadiy Kukarkin and Jonathan Dotan which are at the cutting edge of storing large scale data of high cultural significance in the Filecoin network. They discussed the challenges, successes, and future opportunities presented by these efforts.

Lastly, attendees welcomed Eseohe “Ese” Ojo, the new DWeb Projects Organizer and said farewell to Mai Ishikawa Sutton as she goes off to grad school in Japan. Mai will continue to stay connected with the DWeb community and can be reached on Twitter [@maira](https://twitter.com/maira). Ese can be reached at <dweb@archive.org> or on Twitter [@EseoheOjo](http://twitter.com/eseoheojo). The meetup wrapped up with socializing and networking in Gather.town. 

The next DWeb Meetup **“DWeb Meetup Nov 2021 – Centering Respect, Trust and Equity in the DWeb”** is scheduled for Thursday, November 4, 2021 at 5pm PT, optimized for Asia time zones. At this meetup, we will hear the latest in the DWeb and from our featured speaker Coraline Ada Ehmke on centering respect, trust, and equity in the DWeb. You can read Coraline’s blog post on the DWeb principle of Mutual Respect [here](https://blog.archive.org/2021/09/03/the-sacred-geometry-of-respect-trust-and-equity/). 

We’re interested in hearing from DWeb projects about the breakthroughs, challenges, and new roadmaps they might be exploring. For anyone interested in participating in lightning rounds at this meetup, let us know [here](https://form.jotform.com/203236908715154).

Previous recipients have included librarian and professor of law [Michelle Wu](http://blog.archive.org/2020/10/20/michelle-wu-receives-internet-archive-hero-award-for-establishing-the-legal-basis-for-controlled-digital-lending/), [Phillips Academy](https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/23/unlocking-the-potential-for-every-high-school-library-2019-internet-archive-hero-award/), the [Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2015/11/bhl-receives-internet-archives-internet.html), and the [Grateful Dead](https://www.zdnet.com/article/grateful-dead-win-internet-hero-award-for-viral-marketing/).

This year, we were looking for libraries and librarians who rose to the challenge—this was the year that libraries and librarians have been needed like never before. We wanted to acknowledge the hard work of people who went above and beyond to meet the needs of their communities.

Kanta and Lisa both exemplify the spirit of an Internet Archive Hero:

-   They helped both of their organizations become early adopters of Controlled Digital Lending in 2019. Of course no one knew it at the time, but that early move helped their patrons stay connected to resources throughout library closures of 2020 and 2021 by already having tens of thousands of digitized books available through each library’s participation in the Internet Archive’s [Open Libraries](http://openlibraries.online/) program.
-   They donated collections to the Internet Archive that no longer fit their library’s local collection development priorities, so that we could preserve and digitize the books, and make them available to digital learners everywhere. You can learn more about the [theater books donated from Hamilton Public Library](http://blog.archive.org/2021/05/26/behind-the-curtain-of-the-hamilton-public-library-theater-book-donation/) and the [30,000 books donated by Milton Public Library](http://blog.archive.org/2021/03/10/milton-public-library-reaches-patrons-through-controlled-digital-lending/).
-   They were resources to their professional networks, acting as a point of reference for other librarians interested in learning more about Controlled Digital Lending.
-   They thought broadly about access to collections, considering not only, “What helps my local community?” but also, “What helps the global community?”

In addition to their shared achievements, they also brought their individual strengths to their work:

Kanta’s persistent, steady, and polite pushes—whether about donations logistics, joining Open Libraries, or offering suggestions to expand the program—are what it takes to make things happen. Kanta’s gracious and humble nature belie her steely resolve and approach to program advancement: Kanta just kept at it, politely, until she got the results that she thought was right for her library and her community.

Lisa has joined discussions about Controlled Digital Lending since 2019, participating in several panel presentations for librarians and even participating in discussions with US lawmakers and policy experts alongside ALA Annual in Washington, D.C. Lisa’s professionalism and thoughtfulness helped librarians new to the practice of Controlled Digital Lending understand how their library could benefit.

We’re thrilled to have Ese (pronounced “essay”, she/her) as the new DWeb Projects Organizer. She will be working to foster dialogue and build networks among those building a web that is more private, reliable, secure and open. She will also help steward the [DWeb website](https://getdweb.net) as a resource hub for readings, guides, and events related to the Decentralized Web.

We did a short interview with Ese, where we asked her about her professional background, her thoughts on the connections between digital rights, human rights, and the environment, as well as what it is about the DWeb space that brings her hope.  

**Mai: Can you first tell us about your professional background and what you’ve been working on more recently?**

Ese: I have a bachelor’s degree in International Relations and in May 2020, graduated with a master’s degree in Public Policy and Global Affairs as an African Leader of Tomorrow Scholar from the University of British Columbia. During my undergraduate studies in Nigeria, I took a combination of Law and International Relations courses and developed an interest in human rights and international law. I began working in the non-profit sector after graduation on a range of issues including digital rights, freedom of expression, access to information, academic freedom, gender, democracy, good governance and open government. 

Most recently, I have worked on the [Democratic Health Communications during COVID-19](https://democracy.arts.ubc.ca/2020/11/14/covid-19/), the [Global Platform Governance Network at the Centre for International Governance Innovation](https://www.cigionline.org/activities/global-platform-governance-network/) (CIGI), the [Every Day Advocates](https://www.everydayadvocates.ca/) and [100 Debates](https://www.100debates.ca/) at GreenPAC before joining the DWeb team.

**Mai: Given your background in human rights and digital policy, as well as with your current work in climate organizing, how do you think these issues are intersected**?

Ese: I think these are all interconnected. I began working on environmental issues having worked on other human rights issues previously because I realised and agreed with the [assertion](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Environment/SREnvironment/Pages/AboutHRandEnvironment.aspx#:~:text=About%20human%20rights%20and%20the%20environment&text=A%20safe%2C%20clean%2C%20healthy%20and,unable%20to%20fulfil%20our%20aspirations.) that a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment is integral to the full enjoyment of other fundamental rights and freedoms. 

When it comes to digital rights and right now, as I’m learning more about the decentralised web, I see a lot of parallels. I believe that the original vision for the web and the vision for the decentralized web is meant to be inclusive, private, reliable, secure, and open. It is often said and [reaffirmed](https://www.osce.org/fom/250656) that “the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online.”  Achieving all of this requires that special attention is paid to what harms we see offline are being reproduced online and even beyond this, what new ones are being created by these spaces. We can only achieve this if everyone in the community is committed to doing their part in small and big ways to create, protect, and defend the world and the web we want. 

**Mai: What aspects of the decentralized web bring you hope? Are there specific projects or examples that come to mind that demonstrate to you how decentralized technologies can better secure our human rights both online and offline?**

The potential for peer-to-peer relationships and control by many rather than a select few holds a lot of promise. I am hopeful that this will bring about alternative solutions to the problems we face now and mean greater, more meaningful access for many. I also hope that this community can learn from the mistakes already made as we work together to build something better — not just in comparison to what already exists but looking beyond to fill some of the gaps too. I am still exploring projects and examples of decentralized technologies and look forward to learning more about them.

**Mai: Let me ask you a final, less serious question then! What do you like to do for fun, online and offline?**

If my head isn’t buried in a book, I can typically be found rewatching Downton Abbey or Pride and Prejudice. On a rare sunny Vancouver day, I enjoy soaking up some sun at the beach, park, or sea wall.

[Internet Archive Canada Responds to Canada’s Wide-Ranging Online Harms Proposal](https://blog.archive.org/2021/10/01/internet-archive-canada-responds-to-canadas-wide-ranging-online-harms-proposal/)
======================================================================================================================================================================================================

It is an unfortunate truth that libraries have long been called upon to censor or destroy knowledge—a topic we [recently explored](http://blog.archive.org/2021/06/01/burning-the-books-a-conversation-with-richard-ovenden-abby-smith-rumsey/) with Richard Ovenden, author of *Burning the Books: A History of the Deliberate Destruction of Knowledge*. Indeed, Richard Ovenden has argued that, by standing against such attempts, libraries perform an essential function in support of democracy, the rule of law, and an open society. In the circumstances, it should be no surprise that libraries and librarians tend to react with some alarm to legislative proposals to censor or destroy information—no matter how well intentioned they may be.

So it was with some alarm that Internet Archive Canada reviewed the Government of Canada’s [latest proposals](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/campaigns/harmful-online-content.html) to address “online harms.” As [EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/o-no-canada-fast-moving-proposal-creates-filtering-blocking-and-reporting-rules-1) and others have noted, policymakers around the world are exploring a range of options—many of them “dangerously misguided”—to address harmful online expression. Canada’s proposal appears to be the latest in this line. As Professor Michael Geist has [explained](https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2021/08/law-bytes-podcast-episode-99/), the Government’s plans:

> “include the creation of a bureaucratic super-structure featuring a new Digital Safety Commission, a digital tribunal to rule on content removal, and a social media regulation advisory board. . . . \[and also\] envisions a myriad of takedown requirements, content filtering, complaints mechanisms, and even website blocking”

Internet Archive Canada expressed some of its own concerns with the online harms proposal in a [submission](https://archive.org/details/iac-response-to-online-harms-proposal) to the government last week. Our friends at [Open Media](https://openmedia.org/article/item/openmedias-response-to-the-harmful-content-consultation), and many others, did the same. Like Open Media, we are hoping for the best, while standing ready to engage further should legislation on the issue emerge. We hope all concerned Canadians will do the same.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sharelogo_finance-1024x538.jpeg" class="wp-image-23431" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sharelogo_finance-1024x538.jpeg 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sharelogo_finance-300x158.jpeg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sharelogo_finance-768x403.jpeg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sharelogo_finance-624x328.jpeg 624w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sharelogo_finance.jpeg 1200w" width="1024" height="538" /></figure>Yesterday, Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Representative Anna Eshoo (D-California) [sent an inquiry](https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/092321%20Wyden%20Eshoo%20Letter%20to%20Penguin%20Random%20House.pdf) to each of the “Big Five” book publishers to investigate their activities in the library e-book market. As the Senator and Congresswoman [noted](https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-eshoo-press-big-five-publishers-on-costly-overly-restrictive-e-book-contracts-with-libraries), rather than simply selling books to libraries, publishers insist on using “restrictive and expensive licensing agreements,” leaving libraries to face with “skyrocket\[ing\]” prices and temporary “leases,” “often at a much higher markup than what the average consumer pays for the same title.” 

These practices have led to outcry by librarians and others around the world, including the \#[ebookSoS](https://academicebookinvestigation.org/) Campaign to Investigate the Academic eBook Market. Following careful reporting on the topic in [The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/publishers-are-taking-the-internet-to-court/), the [Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/publishers-are-using-e-books-to-extort-schools-and-libraries), and the [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/an-app-called-libby-and-the-surprisingly-big-business-of-library-e-books), as well as [campaigning](https://www.libraryfutures.net/post/library-victory-wyden-and-eshoo-demand-answers-from-big-publishers) by [Library Futures](https://www.libraryfutures.net/) and others, the Wyden-Eshoo inquiry seeks information on the restrictions the publishers place on their e-books, their outsize costs, and any legal actions they have taken to prevent libraries from engaging in traditional lending practices, among other things. The publishers have until October 7 to respond.

We are pleased that government officials are looking carefully at these issues. Libraries need to be able to buy books; publisher licensing models restrict libraries’ core functions of preservation and lending. That is why we have [long sought](http://blog.archive.org/2011/04/16/open-library-buying-e-books-from-publishers/) to actually purchase e-books from publishers. But the big publishers, in a curiously coordinated fashion, have refused to do so—instead using the digital transition to impose onerous and [expensive](https://academicebookinvestigation.org/) licenses on libraries, and to sue the Internet Archive for doing digitally what libraries have always done physically, preserve and lend books. This letter shows that some in Washington, if not in the publishing houses, still have the public interest in mind.

It is also the latest in a groundswell of support for Controlled Digital Lending. As the letter notes, “it is imperative that libraries can continue their traditional lending functions” in the digital age. Controlled Digital Lending allows libraries to do just that. The [Boston Library Consortium](https://blc.org/CDLforILL), the [International Federation of Library Associations](https://www.ifla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/assets/clm/statements/ifla_position_-_en-_controlled_digital_lending.pdf), and even large commercial organizations like [ProQuest](https://exlibrisgroup.com/press-release/controlled-digital-lending-to-play-a-larger-role-in-ex-libris-products/) are lining up behind Controlled Digital Lending. 

To learn more about CDL, and the importance of digital ownership for the future of libraries, consider joining our virtual [Library Leaders Forum](https://blog.archive.org/2021/09/21/library-leaders-forum-2021-digital-ownership-the-future-of-library-collections/) this October.

With the Canadian federal election [coming to its conclusion](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/federal-election-2021-trudeau-liberals-wherry-1.6183518), many eyes are turning to the last government’s proposals for internet and copyright policy reform. Unfortunately, some of these were quite concerning, such as an [“online harms” proposal](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/campaigns/harmful-online-content.html) that the Electronic Frontier Foundation called “[dangerously misguided](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/o-no-canada-fast-moving-proposal-creates-filtering-blocking-and-reporting-rules-1)“; all Canadians should [learn more](https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2021/08/law-bytes-podcast-episode-99/) about this proposal and [use Open Media’s tool](https://action.openmedia.org/page/90274/action/1) to let the government know what you think. Fortunately, other policy actions, such as the [Consultation on Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/693.nsf/eng/00316.html#s21), present more promise.

Internet Archive Canada recently made a [submission](https://archive.org/details/iac-submission-re-canadian-ai-consultation) in response to this AI consultation. As mentioned in the submission—and as recognized in the consultation paper​​ itself—AI raises a fundamental and recurring copyright question: how to ensure the law keeps pace with technological change. In our view, what history suggests as an answer is not interminable legislative tweaks, but rather flexible copyright frameworks, including flexible limitations and exceptions like the fair use doctrine. The Supreme Court of Canada has shown a wonderful and [enduring commitment](http://blog.archive.org/2021/08/03/supreme-court-of-canada-reaffirms-public-access-as-a-primary-goal-of-copyright/) to a flexible conception of fair dealing—most recently in the [*York University v. Access Copyright*](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18972/index.do) case. Why not continue down this path and simply reaffirm the flexible and open nature of fair dealing in Canada today?

The artificial intelligence consultation itself helps prove the point. The Government has been considering taking action on artificial intelligence since a [review](https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/421/INDU/Reports/RP10537003/indurp16/indurp16-e.pdf) of the Copyright Act commenced all the way back in 2017 (itself set in motion years earlier). In the years between then and now, should Canada’s technology industry have taken a wait-and-see approach, while others made [extraordinary investments](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02360-7) in AI? Why spend half a decade or more tweaking narrow legislation when broadly flexible limitations and exceptions can and do fill this gap? And flexibility provides a host of other benefits, including for AI itself. For example, AI is not immune from the ancient maxim, [garbage in, garbage out](https://xkcd.com/2295/), to say nothing of the [bias](https://www.levendowski.net/copyright-ai-bias) and other similar problems with AI. As a result, it is important that AI researchers and others be able to analyze datasets both before and after ingestion, and that copyright not stand as an undue obstacle to this work. Legal frameworks empowered by flexible copyright limitations and exceptions, such as [controlled digital lending](https://controlleddigitallending.org/), can help facilitate this process. 

In the end, the AI consultation offers much to be thankful for, including an open and transparent process and many good ideas. We look forward to continuing to work with our Canadian friends and neighbors to ensure good copyright policy and strong libraries in the 21st century and beyond.

Following the success of last year’s virtual Forum, which brought together hundreds of attendees from all over the world, we will again host a series of online workshops, presentations, and discussion sessions over four weeks in October. [**Register now!**](http://libraryleadersforum.org/)

This year, we are focusing our discussions around the theme, “**Digital Ownership & the Future of Library Collections**.” As more content moves digital, and as publishers refuse to sell ebooks to libraries in favor of restrictive licensing models, librarians wonder, “What will our library collections look like?” We will explore this question and related issues throughout the [Library Leaders Forum sessions and conference workshops](http://libraryleadersforum.org/), which include:

Library Leaders Forum
---------------------

**Session I: Community Dialogue**  
*October 13 @ 10am PT / 1pm ET* – [Register](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_CTiXGiJ5R6GM_YIVJtvkBA)  
In our first session, hear from library leaders as they navigate the challenges of the ebook marketplace, and their concerns about the future of library collections as content moves digital. We’ll also be joined by copyright experts and publishers for a panel discussion on digital ownership.

**Session II: Community Impact**  
*October 20 @ 10am PT / 1pm ET* – [Register](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_lkvG3xPwT_60QEpT8OcBMg)  
In our second session, we’ll explore the impacts that digital collections have had for libraries during the pandemic. Hear firsthand from educators & librarians about the value of digitized library collections for the patrons, students, and communities they serve. We’ll also feature new developments at the Internet Archive, and how these advances help connect digital learners with books, articles, and other resources. We’ll finish the session by awarding the Internet Archive Hero Award 2021.

Conference Workshops
--------------------

**Controlled Digital Lending: Unlocking the Library’s Full Potential**  
*October 7 @ 10am PT / 1pm ET* – [Register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/controlled-digital-lending-unlocking-the-librarys-full-potential-tickets-173821172807)  
Last month, Library Futures Foundation released a new policy document, “[Controlled Digital Lending: Unlocking the Library’s Full Potential](https://www.libraryfutures.net/policy-document-2021).” Library Futures Foundation developed this document in consultation with the Intellectual Property and Information Policy (iPIP) Clinic at Georgetown Law. The document covers all the benefits, innovations, and goals that are the basis of any controlled digital lending system and makes the crucial connection between CDL and issues of equity. It expands beyond the legal rationale laid out in the Controlled Digital Lending (CDL) White Paper by clarifying the core principles that are the foundations of a library’s mission to provide access to materials to serve the public good.

This session will provide an opportunity to hear from the authors of the policy document, to engage in a virtual discussion, and to give your feedback on how this document may be useful to your community.

**Empowering Libraries Through Controlled Digital Lending**  
*October 12 @ 10am PT / 1pm ET* – [Register](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_2xoZjoz0SKuUvO29a3X0xA)  
The Internet Archive’s Open Libraries program empowers libraries to lend digital books to patrons using Controlled Digital Lending. Attendees will learn how CDL works, the benefits of the Open Libraries program, and the impact that the program is having for partner libraries and the communities they serve.

**Resource Sharing with the Internet Archive**  
*October 27 @ 10am PT / 1pm ET* – [Register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/resource-sharing-with-the-internet-archive-tickets-173835766457)  
Learn about the Internet Archive’s new resource sharing initiatives and how your library can participate.
