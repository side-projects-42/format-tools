My earliest memories of the Archive are using the <a href="http://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> to find old copies of my <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19980124185340/http://www.jessamyn.com/">first web sites</a> (many now lost to 302 redirects) and other memory-holed content. I lived on the West Coast, was fresh out of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19961222161307/http://weber.u.washington.edu/~gslis/index.html">library school</a> at the University of Washington and used my nascent blog to yammer on about, among other things, all the great free culture stuff on the Web. The old links to my blog still work but the same can’t be said for an incredible amount of content online. The Internet Archive is the online memory for many of us.</p>
<p>I use the internet to make the local global, and vice versa. Here are some other things I love at the Internet Archive.</p>
<p><strong>Maps of Home (and elsewhere)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/usgs_drg_vt_43072_h6"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-29-at-13.34.31-150x150.png" alt="I can see my house from here." class="size-thumbnail wp-image-10446" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>I can see my house from here.</p>
<p>My home in Vermont is in a bit of an Internet shadow. This is the good news and the bad news. One of the things this means is that if I want to go hiking or exploring, there may not be a ready online resource I can consult for trail and terrain maps. USGS maps are supposedly free but getting access to them used to be complicated if not impossible. Enter the <a href="http://libremap.org/">Libre Map Project</a> where <a href="http://ransom.redjar.org/">a team of people</a> donated money and time and resources to make <a href="https://archive.org/details/maps_usgs">USGS maps of all fifty states</a> available and searchable from one central location at the Internet Archive. Oh hey look, <a href="https://archive.org/details/usgs_drg_vt_43072_g6">there’s a review by me</a> from 2009.</p>
<p><strong>Family Histories (mine and others’)</strong></p>
<p>The last Joseph Thomas West listed on this page is my grandfather. Joseph Thomas West IV was my dad. I found this book once before, digging through Massachusetts libraries shortly after college. I had a bunch of its pages stuffed into a folder someplace. It was a joy to find it again.</p>

<p>On the other side of my family, my great-grandparents were just arriving in the US at the turn of the last century. <a href="https://archive.org/details/13thcensus1910po870unit">Accessing the US Census through the Archive</a> means I could track them as they moved from New Jersey to New York and back out to New Jersey. Morris is my grandfather. In the 1910 census he was six years old.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/genealogy"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-29-at-14.09.10.png" alt="census form with Cohon names on it." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10449" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-29-at-14.09.10.png 621w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-29-at-14.09.10-300x44.png 300w" width="621" height="92" /></a></p>
<p>The Archive has <a href="https://archive.org/details/genealogy">a wealth of searchable and downloadable family history books</a> many of which are unavailable elsewhere online.</p>
<p><strong>Ten+ years of Matisyahu shows</strong></p>

<p>Live at Red Rocks</p>
<p>For Hannukah or any time, <a href="https://archive.org/details/Matisyahu">Matisyahu’s hazzan-esque lyrical reggae rapping is a tonic for a hectic life</a>. Even better to listen to (and easier to embed) with the newer version of the Archive’s site. I keep this on background when I answer Open Library emails and do other keyboard-intensive work. Thanks to Matisyahu for <a href="https://archive.org/details/Matisyahu&amp;tab=about">allowing the Archive</a> to store and distribute his music as part of their extensive <a href="https://archive.org/details/etree">Live Music Archive</a>.</p>

<p>When the BookReader was first released as a way for people to read books online using a book-like interface, it was way ahead of the curve. The online reading experience has improved elsewhere but the Archive is still one of the first places I go to find public domain content (books and magazines) to read, share, answer reference questions, or just use in my presentations. So many libraries in <a href="https://archive.org/details/americana">North and South America</a> (or <a href="https://archive.org/details/toronto">Canada</a> specifically) and <a href="https://archive.org/details/africanlibraries">Africa</a> have great collections at the Archive from the <a href="https://archive.org/details/biodiversity">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a> to <a href="https://archive.org/details/newyorkpubliclibrary">New York Public Library</a> to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/usnationallibraryofmedicine">US National Library of Medicine</a> to <a href="https://archive.org/details/aljam3alibrary">13,000 books in Arabic</a>. <a href="https://archive.org/details/comics">Comics</a>! <a href="https://archive.org/details/warrenpublishing">Creepy magazines</a>! <a href="https://archive.org/details/regionaldigitizationmass?and%5B%5D=subject%3A%22School%20yearbooks%22">Yearbooks</a>! <a href="https://archive.org/details/cdl?and%5B%5D=subject%3A%22Encyclopedias%20and%20dictionaries%22">Encyclopedias and dictionaries</a>!</p>
<p>And all of it is available for anyone, for free, whenever they want it.</p>

<p><strong><em>No. 7, 15 February 2013</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks!</strong></p>
<p>We’re grateful to everyone who helped with our end of the year campaign to get four new Petaboxes; that’s four thousand terabytes of storage. We look forward to filling the fifteen hundred plus hard drives with all sorts of interesting material. Stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>From the Archive’s Mailbox</strong></p>
<p>I just want to thank you for existing. I suffered a concussion three weeks ago, and your audio books have been a huge blessing as I’m not allowed to do whole lot while I recover, but listening to audio books like Harry Potter is one of the few things I am allowed to do, and those things are so expensive to buy that I could only afford to buy one, fortunately after I finished that one I found you. Anyway being able to listen has kept me sane over these last few weeks and I want to thank you for that.</p>

<p><strong>More Dangerous Than Dynamite</strong></p>
<p>We’ve all had this experience: we’re tired, or just trying to save a few dollars, so we decide to skip a trip to the dry cleaners and clean our clothes with gasoline in the kitchen. Well, it turns out this practice can be dangerous, as this film from the <a href="http://archive.org/details/prelinger">Prelinger Archives</a> demonstrates.</p>
<p>And the special effects are, well, really special.</p>

<p><strong>Back Forty Live at Founders on January 19, 2013</strong></p>
<p>The band’s Internet site claims that their music combines, “funk, bluegrass, rock, folk, reggae, Irish, jazz, experimentation, blues, and swing elements.” Have a listen and see if you don’t agree.</p>

<p><strong>The English Dance of Death, from the Designs of Thomas Rowlandson; 1903</strong></p>
<p>This book is split into two volumes and was originally published in twenty-four monthly parts (1814-16). The subject beautifully portrays the “necessary end” of us all using superstition, highly artistic engravings and skillfully written poetry: “… but frolic nature will undo, the works of art and genius too …”, “… justice slept, while reason saw the deed and wept …” This is a literary gem that lets any curious reader contemplate their journey to the grave.</p>

<p><strong><em>No. 6, 14 December 2012</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>One down, three to go!</strong></p>
<p>With help from a generous, anonymous donor who’s matching other donations three to one through the end of the year, we now have enough funding to buy a new Petabox! We now have <em>only seventeen days left</em> to get the three more we’ll need in 2013.</p>
<p>These massive servers are the backbone of the Archive, and critical to our continued growth. To all of you who’ve contributed to our fundraising drive, thanks from all of us here at the Internet Archive. If you can help us reach our goal by making a tax-deductible donation, we’d be grateful.</p>

<p><strong>Books in Browsers presentations now online</strong></p>
<p>In October, the Internet Archive hosted the Books in Browsers conference, which covered achievements in moving books to the web, vending and lending, the design and effective deployment of ebooks and reading experiences for web environments, the portability of books and bookshelves, reader application interoperability, storage and transmission security (including encryption and caching), the legal and user consequences of book licensing versus purchase, and ramifications for user privacy and data protection.</p>
<p>Peter Brantley, director of Bookserver at the Internet Archive, provided an insightful summary of the two-day event: the new publishing doesn’t care about formats, it cares about story-telling. It is neutral about content-types, because all content-types can be manipulated on the web. That may seem prosaic, but it is actually revolutionary. We’re used to seeing tools that add video to textual narratives, or synchronize audio-based playback. But when you invent tools for the web, you can manipulate a vast array of content within the browser, and an author’s ability to integrate the reader into the experience of the story has few constraints. Indeed, one can expect those constraints to continue to yield under the pressure of increasingly flexible representations. Once technology liberates vision, it is only a matter of imagination becoming real.</p>
<p>If you’d like to learn more, the presentations are online:</p>

<p>I have been watching the Pathé films with tears in my eyes, and here is why. You don’t show the film credits, but if you look at them you’ll see the film editor in chief is Leonard C. Hein, my dad. I believe he was president of his local union #707 in New York City. He worked for Pathé news for over 25 years, right up until the bankruptcy auction which he attended. Thank you for preserving this work!<br />

<p><strong>Picks from the Archive</strong></p>
<p><strong>Decoded: <em>An essay towards the reconciling of differences among Christians</em></strong></p>
<p>A while back, I scanned a book with a ton of shorthand notes, thought to be written by Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.org/stream/essaytowardsreco00will#page/n13/mode/2up" class="uri">http://archive.org/stream/essaytowardsreco00will#page/n13/mode/2up</a></p>
<p>It has since been confirmed that the handwriting is his, a discovery made possible through the availability of our high-quality online version. The book itself is pretty fragile, and would not stand up to constant reading, as well as the digital images are easy to zoom in on for further study. Most of the code is quite small. Still, the Internet Archive’s scan of the book provided researchers the raw data needed to examine and ultimately decipher Williams’ code.</p>
<p><a href="http://bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/12/04/brown-university-students-crack-roger-williams-code/6n1B9sLy812OyfOwWdIHvM/story.html" class="uri">http://bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/12/04/brown-university-students-crack-roger-williams-code/6n1B9sLy812OyfOwWdIHvM/story.html</a></p>
<p>I find it so very cool to have been the one to put this book online and help in some small part to a better understanding of my state, and indeed nation’s history. A hurrah for the studious use of a book’s digital version.</p>

<p><strong>Selected Collection: Crap from the Past<br />

<p>This is a pop music radio show for people who already know plenty about pop music. Hosted by Ron “Boogiemonster” Gerber, it’s broadcast Friday nights from 10:30 to midnight on KFAI, Minneapolis. This collection of over twelve-hundred recordings goes back two decades, a millennium, or “since the days of DOS,” depending on how you slice it.</p>

<p><em>Rocketship X-M</em> landed on the red planet over sixty years before NASA’s <em>Mars Curiosity</em> rover touched down there recently. Hollywood years, that is. Rocketship X-M is the story of five astronauts (played by Lloyd Bridges, Osa Massen, John Emery, Noah Beery, Jr., and Hugh O’Brien) who blast off to explore the moon but end up on Mars instead. Stay tuned for the ending …</p>

<p><strong><em>Through The Looking-Glass (and what Alice found there)</em>, Lewis Carroll</strong></p>
<p>This is a first edition “Presentation Copy” of the followup to Alice In Wonderland. Not only is this a personal favorite that blew my mind when I first read it some years ago, but this is a first edition copy in excellent condition with fifty of the original illustrations by John Tenniel. I don’t need to describe the impact this book had on literature, but what makes this copy so fascinating to me is that inside the front cover is a note in the authors own hand, “Emma Vine, with the author’s kind regards. Christmas 1871.” There is also a penciled-in note saying that Emma Vine was Lewis Carroll’s nursemaid. This was very exciting for me to discover and I can’t believe I was able to see something like this with my own eyes, a real literary treasure.</p>

<p><strong>Another Day, Another Petabyte</strong></p>
<p>Did you wonder where the Internet Archive stores millions of books, movies, recordings, and 150 billion web pages? Not in some conceptual cloud, but on our custom-designed Petabox servers, that’s where. This week, we’re installing another petabyte of storage; that’s a thousand terabytes or a million gigabytes.</p>
<p>Each Petabox is comprised of ten racks; each rack holds thirty-eight three-terabyte hard drives, two of which are used for the operating systems with the remainder used for data.</p>
<p>Here’s what one of the racks looks like fresh out of the shipping container …</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/rack.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/rack.jpg" title="rack" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5229" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/rack.jpg 800w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/rack-300x211.jpg 300w" width="800" height="563" /></a></p>
<p>And when the racks are assembled into Petaboxes …</p>

<p><strong>Brewster’s Report</strong></p>
<p>I’m especially interested in <a href="http://archive.org/details/usfederalcourts">the Recap collection</a> because it is huge, useful, and an interesting example of an archive that builds itself. This set of court filings–in electronic form–are from <a href="http://www.pacer.gov/">the U.S. government’s Pacer database</a>. When lawyers file documents in federal court, they submit them in electronic form such as a PDF, a Microsoft Word document, or a scanned paper printout. The documents that can be made public go into a database called Pacer, which is freely available to the public.</p>
<p>Well, not quite free. The government sells access to these public documents for <a href="http://www.pacer.gov/psc/faq.html">ten cents a page</a>, with a document cap of three dollars. This seems to be a fair price for someone who just needs a few documents, but the cost is prohibitive for someone who needs lots and lots of data for their research.</p>
<p>And that brings us to Recap (Pacer spelled backward). A group of academics and activists thought of <a href="http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2011/02/03/pacer-recap-and-the-movement-to-free-american-case-law/">an ingenious scheme</a> to make wholesale access available court documents for free as well as benefit the individual users that make the project possible.</p>
<p>They created <a href="http://mycroft.mozdev.org/search-engines.html?name=recapthelaw.org">a Firefox browser plugin</a> that notices when a visitor searches the Pacer site. If the court filing the user is looking for is available from the Internet Archive’s Recap collection, the document may be downloaded for free. If the researcher pays for and downloads a court filing from the Pacer site, it’s automatically added to the Recap collection.</p>
<p>As a result, the Internet Archive hosts a large database of over 700,000 public court cases. This collection of millions and millions of documents, in a publicly accessible archive, can be freely used in bulk for research purposes.</p>
<p>This automated insertion into the Internet Archive was a new use of our S3-like interface; it required patience and debugging as the Princeton programmers and the Internet Archive staff worked out the kinks. As a result of meticulous work, the system has been running almost unattended for three years. <a href="http://archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.cand.239768">The most popular case</a> at the moment involves the Apple Computer and Samsung trademark dispute; it’s been downloaded 1,100 times in the last week. <a href="http://archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.gamd.77605">The most popular filing</a> has been downloaded almost 35,000 times.</p>
<p>We are excited about building independent archive support into computer applications, and offering bulk access to materials for all sorts of uses beyond what was imagined by the original database builders.  We hope more services become “Archive aware.”</p>
<p>Congratulations to <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten/">Ed Felton</a>, <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">Aaron Swartz</a>, Sam Stoller, <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~harlanyu/">Harlan Yu</a>, <a href="http://timothyblee.com/about-me/">Tim Lee</a> for making a new type of automated archive service work.</p>

<p>Since you use a gazillion hard drives, which brands are the best? Which brands should I avoid?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p><em>— Nancy Miller</em></p>
<p>In our experience, they’re fungible. Hard drives all fail sooner or later, so we buy whatever’s the best value when it’s time to add another terabyte. We duplicate (backup) the data, and replace the drives that die, which they generally do under warranty. Take care of your data and don’t worry about the fallibility of hardware.</p>
<p><strong>Selected Collection: The Crittenden Automotive Library</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.org/details/crittendenautomotivelibrary">The Crittenden Automotive Library</a> was started in 2006 as a collection of automotive information including various forms of media (audio, video, and text) at <a href="http://CarsAndRacingStuff.com">CarsAndRacingStuff.com</a></p>
<p>It is a large collection of information relating to not only cars, trucks, and motorcycles, but also the roads they drive on, the races they compete in, cultural works based on them, government regulation of them, and the people who design, build, and drive them. We are dedicated to the preservation and free distribution of information relating to all types of cars and road-going vehicles for those seeking the greater understanding of these very important elements of modern society, how automobiles have affected how people live around the world, or for the general study of automotive history and anthropology. In addition to the historical knowledge, we preserve current events for future generations.</p>

<p><strong>Bathhouse Row Adaptive Use Program, The Fordyce Bathouse: Technical Report 5 (1985)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.org/details/bathhouserowadap00nat5">This particular Bathhouse Row report</a> is interesting for several reasons. One, its pictures show us about what the interior and exterior of some historic bathhouses in the present day should look like, as well as what they looked like on the inside when they were operational. Two, the exterior drawing plan of the Fordyce Bathhouse is oh so intricate and lovely. Three, all the materials we are currently scanning relate to national parks, so it is neat to find an area in the National Park System where natural resources, like hot springs, were used rather than preserved in their natural state. And fourth, we are fortunate enough today to reap the benefits of what replaced the bathhouse movement of centuries ago, which is spas and personal baths.</p>

<p><strong>Ramadan 30, 1433 ~ Madeenah Tahajjud Audio</strong></p>
<p>Ramadan ended a few weeks ago, an observance that went largely unnoticed outside of the Muslim community. These recordings document an aural environment literally unheard of by most people in the western world, and have the same resonance as a recording of a Kansas preacher might have for a Bedouin nomad.</p>

<p><strong>Brewster’s Report</strong></p>
<p>The Internet Archive is now offering <a href="http://archive.org/details/bittorrent">over 1,000,000 torrents</a> including our <a href="http://archive.org/details/etree">live music concerts</a>, the <a href="http://archive.org/details/prelinger">Prelinger movie collection</a>, the <a href="http://archive.org/details/librivoxaudio">librivox audio book collection</a>, <a href="http://archive.org/details/feature_films">feature films</a>, <a href="http://archive.org/details/oldtimeradio">old time radio</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/toronto">lots and lots of books</a>, and all new uploads from our patrons <a href="http://archive.org/details/opensource_audio">into</a> <a href="http://archive.org/details/opensource_movies">Community</a> <a href="http://archive.org/details/opensource">collections</a> (with more to follow).</p>
<p>BitTorrent is the now fastest way to download items from the Archive, because the BitTorrent client downloads simultaneously from two different Archive servers located in two different datacenters, and from other Archive users who have downloaded these Torrents already. The distributed nature of BitTorrent swarms and their ability to retrieve Torrents from local peers may be of particular value to patrons with slower access to the Archive, for example those outside the United States or inside institutions with slow connections.</p>

<p>I really appreciate the work that you’re doing, most notably, in the approach that you’re taking to digitizing historic books. The high quality reproductions of the illustrations in these titles are incredibly valuable for the research and writing that I’m doing. There’s a lot of material  I wouldn’t have if not for the Internet Archive. Further, there’s quite a bit more where I’d have something, but of much lower quality, if not for your work.</p>

<p><strong>Selected Collection: Global Lives Project</strong></p>
<p>The Global Lives Project is collaboratively building a video library of human life experience that reshapes how we as both producers and viewers conceive of cultures, nations, and people outside of our own communities.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://archive.org/details/globallivesproject_Edith_Kaphuka_2007_nya_Ngwale_Village_MW-ZO_051542-053043">this recording</a> documents one day in Edith Kaphuka’s life. We see the thirteen-year-old student from Ngwale Village, Malawi fetching water, cleaning the dishes, and gardening. For those of us who don’t understand Chichewa, Malawi’s national language, many details are lost. In a way, the mystery is part of the charm of this glimpse into what for most of us is a very different way of life. And because of the work’s Creative Commons license, there’s nothing to prevent anyone from adding subtitles in another language.</p>

<p><strong>The Atom Strikes! (1945)</strong></p>
<p>This film by the US Army Signal Corps Pictorial Service was filmed months after the first atomic bomb was used in warfare sixty-seven years ago yesterday.</p>
<p>For the most part, <a href="http://archive.org/details/ArmyPictorialServiceSignalCorpsTheAtomStrikes">The Atom Strikes!</a> looks like an engineering film examining the effects of the bomb on different types of structures. It’s almost surreal in that there are very few references to any human injuries. A German Jesuit in Hiroshima at the time was interrogated to find out how the Japanese people reacted to the attack(!). He explains, ” … we began to admire the skill of the Americans, and especially since the majestic B29s appeared over Tokyo, practically every Japanese admired the technical skill of the Americans.” The film contains actual footage of the nuclear explosion  over Nagasaki, apparently filmed from the B29 that dropped the bomb.</p>
<p>Of course, no one would expect dispassionate objectivity from military filmmakers months after the end of WWII. Similarly, you’ll find equally heavy-handed propagandizing in <a href="http://archive.org/details/AV_258-HIROSHIMA_AND_NAGASAKI-_WHAT_PEOPLE_EXPERIENCED">Hiroshima and Nagasaki: What People Experienced</a>. Fast-forward through the first twenty minutes of punditry from 1985 and you’ll discover deeply disturbing imagery (you were warned) of radiation poisoning and worse from 1945.</p>

<p>Dodd, Mead and Company published <a href="http://archive.org/details/halfhoursinfarno00newy"><em>Half Hours in the Far North, Life Amid Snow and Ice</em></a> in 1870. With arctic wildlife chock full of industrial pollutants and Greenland’s ice sheet melting at the fastest rate in recorded history, this book is even more distant than the chronological years would suggest. It also features great engravings from the days before photographic reproduction was commercially viable.</p>

<p><strong>Radiators Live at Parrish Room on 21 April 2006.</strong></p>
<p>If there’s such a thing as the New Orleans sound, it might be described as a mashup of the hear blues, jazz, Zydeco, soul, swamp rock, swing, with perhaps s splash of gospel. That’s also a fairly accurate description of what the New Orleans band the Radiators played for a third of a century. The group disbanded last year, but this 2006 recording captures them in fine fettle.</p>

<p><strong>News from the Internet Archive</strong><br />
<em>No. 2, 24 July 2012</em></p>
<p><strong>Which Came First?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone visiting the Internet Archive’s Internet site has seen our logo: an abstract rendering of a classical building with four columns. And anyone visiting our San Francisco headquarters in recent years has seen a similar edifice.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/archive-1200.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/archive-1200-1024x737.jpg" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-4840" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/archive-1200-1024x737.jpg 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/archive-1200-300x216.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/archive-1200.jpg 1200w" width="640" height="460" /></a></p>
<p>So which came first, the chicken or the egg? (Or, as our Russian friends say, the sturgeon or the caviar?) In fact, the logo was designed and adopted when the Internet Archive was created in 1996. At the time, no one dreamed we’d buy a building that looked like the logo in 2009. Life imitates art?</p>
<p><strong>Brewster’s report</strong></p>
<p>With the Electronic Frontier Foundation, we are trying to stop a bad Internet law in Washington State, which got a <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2012/07/22/new-washington-state-internet-law-gets-its-day-in-court/">hearing this week</a>. On a cheerier note, the Internet Archive uploaders hit a few milestones recently:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.org/details/medicineintheamericas">Medicine in the Americas</a> passed 6,000 books.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.org/details/usfederalcourts">Court cases</a> documents uploaded by volunteers using the Pacer system passed 700,000 cases. (Thanks to the Recap team at Princeton.)</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.org/details/publicsafetycode">U.S. Public Safety Codes</a> passed 1,000. (Go, Carl Malamud!)</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.org/details/byuutahvalleyobits">Obituary collection</a> from Utah passed 4,000.</p>
<p>It is great fun to watch these things roll in. (Thank you Hank Bromley for the stats.) Onward!</p>

<p><strong>Selected Recent Collections:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Georges Méliès Collection</strong></p>
<p>Georges Méliès was a French illusionist and filmmaker famous for leading many technical and narrative developments in the earliest days of cinema. A prolific innovator in the use of special effects, he was one of the first  filmmakers to use multiple exposures, time-lapse photography, dissolves, and hand-painted color in his work. Because of his ability to seemingly manipulate and transform reality through cinematography, Méliès is sometimes referred to as the first “Cinemagician.”</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.org/details/georgesmelies" class="uri">http://archive.org/details/georgesmelies</a></p>
<p><strong>The Segundo de Chomón Collection</strong></p>
<p>Segundo Víctor Aurelio Chomón y Ruiz was a pioneering Spanish film director. He produced many short films in France while working for Pathé Frères and has been compared to Georges Méliès  because of his frequent camera tricks and optical illusions. He became involved in film through his wife, who was an actress in Pathé films. In 1902 he became a concessionary for Pathé in Barcelona, distributing its product in Spanish-speaking countries, and managing a factory for the colouring of Pathé films. He began shooting actuality films of Spanish locations for the company, then 1905 moved to Paris where he became a trick film specialist.</p>

<p><strong>Other Picks from the Archive</strong></p>
<p><strong>Drive-In Intermission</strong></p>
<p>This five-minute piece from <a href="http://archive.org/details/DriveInMovieAds">the Drive-In Movies Ads collection</a> presents a fascinating look at a relatively short-lived cultural phenomenon: the drive-in movie theatre.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.org/details/DriveInIntermission13" class="uri">http://archive.org/details/DriveInIntermission13</a></p>
<p>Drive-in theatres have almost vanished from the American landscape. Once upon a time, though, they provided for an inexpensive family outing and a place for dating couples couples to enjoy recreation that may or may not have involved watching a film. That led theatre managers to issue this warning:</p>
<p>HELLO YOUNG LOVERS—WHOEVER YOU ARE—We’re Glad The LOVE BUG Caught Up With You!</p>
<p>But … We Must Insist That You Do Not Allow His Bite To Effect [<em>sic</em>] You Conduct While In This Theatre.</p>
<p>Public Demonstration Of Affection } Will Not Be Tolerated Here.</p>
<p>And in case there was any doubt about taking an unambiguous moral stance, the audience was admonished to, “Attend Your Place of Worship Regularly.”</p>

<p><strong>News from the Internet Archive</strong><br />
No. 1, 18 June 2012</p>
<p>In this issue, Archive-It’s two hundredth partner, picks from our collection, Brewster Kahle talks about Internet Archive news, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Archive Sues to Stop New Washington State Law</strong><br />
The Internet Archive has filed a federal challenge to a new Washington State law that intends to make online service providers criminally liable for providing access to third parties’ offensive materials.</p>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation is representing the Internet Archive in order to block the enforcement of SB 6251, a law aimed at combatting advertisements for underage sex workers but with vague and overbroad language that is squarely in conflict with federal law.</p>
<p>“The Internet Archive, as an online library, archives the World Wide Web and other digital materials for researchers, historians, and the general public,” said Brewster Kahle, Digital Librarian and founder of the Internet Archive. “We strongly support law enforcement efforts to combat child sex trafficking, but this new law could endanger libraries and other entities that bring access to websites and user-generated content.”</p>
<p>Read the entire press release:</p>

<p><strong>From the </strong>Digital Librarian** and Founder**<br />
I was honored to be inducted into the first group of Internet Hall of Fame-ers. We take this as a positive community support for the Internet Archive and my earlier role in helping bring publishing to the Internet. You may read more here: <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2012/04/24/internet-hall-of-fame/" class="uri">http://blog.archive.org/2012/04/24/internet-hall-of-fame/</a></p>
<p>In other news, IPv6 is a new Internet protocol that will bring more addresses and other features to the Internet. Adoption has been slow, so the Internet Society declared June 6th IPv6 day and getting websites and Internet service providers to support it. We put up a page at <a href="http://ipv6.archive.org" class="uri">http://ipv6.archive.org</a> for those intrepid souls with a modified logo, does any IPv6 user get the joke?

<p><strong>Picks from the Archive</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The animal kingdom, arranged according to its organization, serving as a foundation for the natural history of animals : and an introduction to comparative anatomy (1834)</em></strong></p>
<p>Once upon a time, a time before learned scientists talked about string theory and living in eleven dimensions, there was an age in which we knew about our world with certainty. And in the case of this book, we could list and illustrate those things, even though the oldest photograph in the world wasn’t even a decade old. The book promises “with pictures designed after nature,” and delivers.</p>

<p><strong>The Conet Project—Recordings of Shortwave Numbers Stations</strong></p>
<p>If you thought advances in telecommunication, encrypted email, and other new technologies obviated the need for short wave radio, then it’s time to think again. Here are a few lines from the introduction to this remarkable collection.</p>
<p>For more than 30 years, the shortwave radio spectrum has been used by the world’s intelligence agencies to transmit secret messages. These messages are transmitted by hundreds of Numbers Stations. Why has the phenomenon of Numbers Stations gone almost totally unreported? What are the agencies behind the Numbers Stations, and why are the eastern European stations still on the air? Why does the Czech republic operate a Numbers Station 24 hours a day? How is it that Numbers Stations are allowed to interfere with essential radio services like air traffic control and shipping without having to answer to anybody? Why does the Swedish Rhapsody Numbers Station use a small girl’s voice?</p>

<p><strong>Mission Mind Control (July 10, 1979)</strong></p>
<p>“This is the story of a thirty-year search by U.S. intelligence agencies to perfect mind control.” That’s how this 1970 ABC News documentary begins, after an unmistakably seventies musical introduction.</p>
<p>The film, part of the Archive’s FedFlix collection, hasn’t aged well, which is part of its appeal. With no pun intended, what a trip!</p>
