*By Michelle Swanson, an educator and national educational specialist from Eugene, OR*

While education leaders and classroom teachers have discussed the growing issue of the [Digital Divide](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/26/nearly-one-in-five-teens-cant-always-finish-their-homework-because-of-the-digital-divide/) for years, its severity has become painfully clear as classrooms have been forced online during school closures. [The results](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/27/862705225/survey-shows-big-remote-learning-gaps-for-low-income-and-special-needs-children?utm_source=EdSurgeInstruct&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=5-28-2020&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTlRjME56YzJabU5oTkRRMyIsInQiOiI3UUJDOVl1ZGNSTWRmNkNReDh6bnBvdStvUHpMYm5jNWQ2cEhLNlFvdEttRWFWQjAzbEk3QXJYNnd1bGpcL255T2tsaURQWkxSZ2REZ2p4MDREdFAwdjdBVFg0em9GeVpiUUdvaEVKOVg2V2JrWE1yV0hiTmVHdzcrUUprMHNvRFcifQ%3D%3D) of distance learning show low levels of engagement and progress for students from homes lacking internet access and devices. In addition, students facing the digital gap tend to have fewer books at home and live in communities struggling to keep libraries open. The pandemic has brought these serious equity issues to the forefront.

Closing the technology divide by ensuring that every student has a personal learning device and reliable internet access at home is a critical first step. Districts looking for guidance on 1:1 initiatives should look to ISTE’s definition of [equitable technology](https://www.iste.org/standards/essential-conditions/equitable-access) access that makes up one of their “[essential conditions](https://www.iste.org/standards/essential-conditions)” for supporting all learners.

Once students have a computer and WiFi, school leaders can look to the Internet Archive’s digital collections as one part of a multi-pronged strategy to address learner equity. Specifically, these online resources can be used to target issues of resource access, instructional rigor, and special needs access.

**Resource Access Considerations**
----------------------------------

-   **Book and Library Access**  
    By supplementing their onsite collections with online access to the Internet Archive’s [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/), schools can extend a wealth of resources to all learners in a digital learning space that is open 24/7. Books can either be borrowed for one hour or two weeks, depending on availability.

<!-- -->

-   **Diverse Resource Access**  
    Open Library offers diverse reading materials to represent its readers. It includes books from the curated [\#1000 Black Girl Books](https://archive.org/details/1000blackgirlbooks) list created by Marley Dias, a young girl determined to find books with main characters that looked like her. The collection includes books for younger readers like Karen Katz’ [The Colors of Us](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1989128W/The_colors_of_us) and Chris Cleave’s [Little Bee](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5845214W/Little_Bee) for older students.

**Instructional Rigor Considerations**
--------------------------------------

-   **Standards-Aligned Books**  
    Providing rigorous instruction is an important equity strategy. To support high quality teaching and learning, the Internet Archive collections include texts suggested by the [Common Core](http://www.corestandards.org/assets/Appendix_B.pdf) framework. For example, beginning readers can borrow books for reading aloud like Pat Mora’s [Tomas and the Library Lady](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1864488W/Tomas_and_the_Library_Lady), while middle schoolers can explore Mildred Taylor’s [Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16997550W/Roll_of_Thunder_Hear_me_Cry) and high schoolers can tackle [In the Time of Butterflies](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL116089W/In_the_Time_of_the_Butterflies) by Julia Alvarez.

<!-- -->

-   **Grade-Level Appropriate Books**  
    The Internet Archive’s digital libraries include [grade-level appropriate](https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360042654251-National-Emergency-Library-FAQs#h_02ddc58f-da50-4447-a1df-7ebae1bd9216) collections that teachers can use to ensure that all students are appropriately challenged with complex and quality texts.

**Special Needs Access**
------------------------

-   **Read Aloud and Print Disabled Books**  
    For students who need or prefer to listen to and visualize the plot of a story, Open Library provides a read aloud option. When viewing a borrowed book online, students can click on the audio speaker icon and choose their preferred reading speed. For those who are visually impaired and have special software, print disabled books have been formatted through [DAISY](https://openlibrary.org/help/faq/accessing). These tools can support school efforts to employ a [Universal Design for Learning](http://udlguidelines.cast.org/) approach. 

<!-- -->

-   **Print Disabled Collection**  
    To make access to print disabled books across the collection even easier to find, the Internet Archive has curated a Books for [People with Print Disabilities](https://archive.org/details/printdisabled) section. Over 1.5M books are accessible through this page and cover the wide range of topics available in the broader library from History and Science to Children’s literature. 

Working toward educational equity should be core to the mission of every school. By supporting resource access, instructional rigor, and special needs access, tools like the Internet Archive’s digital libraries can help schools move toward this essential goal.

[Controlled digital lending and Open Libraries: helping libraries and readers in times of crisis](https://blog.archive.org/2020/03/09/controlled-digital-lending-and-open-libraries-helping-libraries-and-readers-in-times-of-crisis/)

Posted on [March 9, 2020](https://blog.archive.org/2020/03/09/controlled-digital-lending-and-open-libraries-helping-libraries-and-readers-in-times-of-crisis/ "9:17 pm")<span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/chrisfreeland/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by chrisfreeland">chrisfreeland</a></span></span>

**tldr;** *As libraries face closure across the globe because of coronavirus, [millions of digitized books are now available for free](https://openlibrary.org/) to be borrowed by learn-at-home students and readers. We need more libraries [to join Open Libraries](https://archive.org/details/openlibraries) to offer more copies to patrons; it’s free and easy.*

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/openlibraries-1024x473.png" class="wp-image-19923" /></figure>In response to the global COVID-19 outbreak and related public health concerns, libraries across the nation are closing or scaling back service (see Fremont, Nebraska’s [Keene Memorial Library closure](https://fremonttribune.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/coronavirus-cautionary-measure-fremont-schools-library-senior-center-temporarily-close/article_32e85ed8-b00f-55dd-a870-596aa6832cf6.html); Seattle Public Library’s reduction in [programs and bookmobile service](https://www.spl.org/about-us/the-organization/leadership/a-message-from-the-chief-librarian)).  While Overdrive, Hoopla, and other streaming services provide patrons access to latest best sellers and popular titles, the long tail of reading and research materials available deep within a library’s print collection are often not available through these large commercial services.  What this means is that when libraries face closures in times of crisis, patrons are left with access to only a fraction of the materials that the library holds in its collection.

That’s where the [Internet Archive’s Open Libraries program](http://openlibraries.online/), powered by controlled digital lending, can help.  We empower libraries to turn their print holdings digital, offering digitized versions of the physical books in their collection to their patrons, overcoming distance and closures.  We’ve been acquiring and digitizing millions of the most important books – [school libraries](https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/23/unlocking-the-potential-for-every-high-school-library-2019-internet-archive-hero-award/), [entire college libraries](https://blog.archive.org/2019/12/10/preserving-the-legacy-of-a-library-when-a-college-closes/), [books cited in Wikipedia](https://www.wired.com/story/internet-archive-wikipedia-more-reliable/), [books assigned in courses and included in syllabi](https://blog.archive.org/2018/09/10/revised-wish-list-now-available-1-5m-books-we-want/), etc. – and 1.4 million of those books are now available for anyone to [check out online at archive.org](https://archive.org/details/inlibrary) for free. 

**Open Libraries helps individuals & libraries alike, in the following ways:**

**For individuals**: Individual readers have access to all of the books that Internet Archive has digitized, including [1.4 million modern books](https://archive.org/details/inlibrary).  An Internet Archive library card is free and gives users the ability to check out 5 digitized books at a time.  [Browse our collection today](https://archive.org/details/inlibrary) and start reading immediately!

**For libraries**: Think of Open Libraries as your digital branch library.  The 1.4 million books we’ve digitized are available for you to claim and lend to your patrons.  The process is simple: [join Open Libraries](http://openlibraries.online/join/) and then share your library catalog with us to find out which of your books we’ve already digitized.  We’ll give you a link to those books that you can incorporate back into your catalog, helping your patrons locate these digitized books from within your library catalog and local search. [Join today](http://openlibraries.online/join/).

[Weaving Books into the Web—Starting with Wikipedia](https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/29/weaving-books-into-the-web-starting-with-wikipedia/)

The Internet Archive has transformed 130,000 references to books in Wikipedia into live links to 50,000 digitized Internet Archive books in several Wikipedia language editions including English, Greek, and Arabic. And we are just getting started. By working with Wikipedia communities and scanning more books, both users and robots will link many more book references directly into Internet Archive books. In these cases, diving deeper into a subject will be a single click.

This allows me to do this even in the middle of the night.”

For example, the Wikipedia article on [Martin Luther King, Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr) cites the book *To Redeem the Soul of America*, by Adam Fairclough. That citation now [links directly to page 299](https://archive.org/details/toredeemsoulofam00fair/page/299) inside the digital version of the book provided by the Internet Archive. There are 66 cited and linked books on that article alone.

“What has been written in books over many centuries is critical to informing a generation of digital learners,” said Brewster Kahle, Digital Librarian of the Internet Archive. “We hope to connect readers with books by weaving books into the fabric of the web itself, starting with Wikipedia.”

You can help accelerate these efforts by [sponsoring books](https://openlibrary.org/sponsorship) or funding the effort. It costs the Internet Archive about $20 to digitize and preserve a physical book in order to bring it to Internet readers. The goal is to bring another 4 million important books online over the next several years.  Please [donate](https://archive.org/donate) or [contact us](mailto:info@archive.org) to help with this project.

[Hamilton Public Library joins Open Libraries](https://blog.archive.org/2019/06/03/hamilton-public-library-joins-open-libraries/)
=================================================================================================================================

Posted on [June 3, 2019](https://blog.archive.org/2019/06/03/hamilton-public-library-joins-open-libraries/ "1:08 pm")<span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/chrisfreeland/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by chrisfreeland">chrisfreeland</a></span></span>

In an effort to meet users’ growing needs around access to library materials, [Hamilton Public Library](https://www.hpl.ca/) has joined the Internet Archive’s [Open Libraries](http://openlibraries.online/) program.  

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Central-Library.jpg" alt="Hamilton Public Library’s Central Library, Hamilton, ON" class="wp-image-18328" sizes="(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Central-Library.jpg 796w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Central-Library-300x151.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Central-Library-768x387.jpg 768w" width="796" height="401" /><figcaption>Hamilton Public Library’s Central Library, Hamilton, ON</figcaption></figure>“In today’s rapidly changing access to digital content, it is important that the broader library community works together to build lasting and growing collections of digital content for our customers and communities,” said Paul Takala, Chief Librarian and CEO of Hamilton Public Library. “The Internet Archive has developed a responsible and balanced controlled digital lending (CDL) model. I look forward to a future where all the unique titles we have in our collection – many of which are out of print – can be shared with researchers and learners everywhere. With the Internet Archive’s Open Libraries program, this future is now possible. I encourage all libraries to join this important effort.”  

Internet Archive’s Open Libraries program uses [controlled digital lending](https://controlleddigitallending.org) (CDL) to deliver [nearly one million volumes of digitized texts](https://archive.org/details/inlibrary) to readers and researchers all over the world. Controlled digital lending is a process by which libraries can lend print books to patrons in digitized form, and has been described by copyright experts from major research libraries. Through CDL, libraries use controls to ensure an “owned-to-loaned” ratio, meaning the library circulates the exact number of copies of a specific title it owns, regardless of format, putting controls in place to prevent users from redistributing or copying the digitized version. CDL is not meant to replace existing licensing agreements for modern ebooks; instead, CDL helps libraries provide access to twentieth century publications that don’t have an electronic equivalent.  

Participating in Open Libraries is easy.  After [signing on to the program](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_8y_ahE6gtOGVInd5y0R74AnHhz7RsX6cMmwpbjmDxYrOnQ/viewform), libraries share their catalogs with Internet Archive and our engineers perform an overlap analysis to determine the physical books in a library’s collection that match the books we have digitized.  Where there’s a match, the Internet Archive returns links and catalog records to the digital book so that the library can include these in their catalog.

[Revised wish list now available: 1.5M books we want](https://blog.archive.org/2018/09/10/revised-wish-list-now-available-1-5m-books-we-want/)
==============================================================================================================================================

Posted on [September 10, 2018](https://blog.archive.org/2018/09/10/revised-wish-list-now-available-1-5m-books-we-want/ "6:14 pm")<span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/chrisfreeland/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by chrisfreeland">chrisfreeland</a></span></span>

[<span style="font-weight: 400">Earlier this year</span>](https://blog.archive.org/2018/03/14/lets-build-a-great-digital-library-together-starting-with-a-wishlist/)<span style="font-weight: 400"> we released our </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">Open Libraries wish list</span>](https://archive.org/details/open_libraries_wish_list)<span style="font-weight: 400">, which brought together four datasets to help inform our collection development priorities for Open Libraries.  After working with the wish list for a few months and reviewing our approach, we decided to make a few revisions to the ways in which we brought together the data.  Our wish list was always intended to be an iterative work-in-progress, and we are pleased to release our latest version here: </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">https://archive.org/details/open\_libraries\_wish\_list</span>](https://archive.org/details/open_libraries_wish_list)

[<span style="font-weight: 400">Download wish list now</span>](https://archive.org/details/open_libraries_wish_list)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400">What’s in the wish list?</span>
--------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400">To create the wish list, we brought together four datasets:</span>

1.  <span style="font-weight: 400">OCLC’s list of </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">one million most widely held books</span>](https://www.oclc.org/en/news/releases/2012/201252.html)<span style="font-weight: 400">, based on holdings records of libraries worldwide;</span>
2.  [<span style="font-weight: 400">Library Link</span>](http://library.link/)<span style="font-weight: 400">’s holdings records of North American libraries, leveraging the decisions of thousands of librarians in prioritizing collections for patron use;</span>
3.  [<span style="font-weight: 400">Open Syllabus Project</span>](https://opensyllabusproject.org/)<span style="font-weight: 400">, which has collected syllabi from the Internet to compile the most assigned books in classrooms;</span>
4.  <span style="font-weight: 400">Data about </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">book and scholarly article citations in Wikipedia</span>](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1299540)<span style="font-weight: 400">, published by the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">Wikimedia Foundation</span>](https://wikimediafoundation.org/)<span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">These data help us define a collection of 1.5M books, identified by their ISBNs, that are widely held and frequently cited.  We continue to work on human-mediated efforts to identify collections that are reflective of the diverse voices in our communities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">What’s changed?</span>
-----------------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400">In this </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">latest revision</span>](https://archive.org/details/open_libraries_wish_list)<span style="font-weight: 400"> to the wish list, we decided to keep the focus on materials that are widely held and widely cited by fine tuning the thresholds for inclusion on the list in the following ways:</span>

-   <span style="font-weight: 400">In our previous wish list, we had included xISBN “synonyms” to the ISBNs on the list as a way of increasing the breadth of materials, but realized that approach created scenarios where we could have digitized a different edition than the one cited by a Wikipedia editor, or included on a syllabus.  In the latest revision, we chose to include only the ISBNs included on each list.</span>
-   <span style="font-weight: 400">We also revised our approach to the Wikipedia citations, including those books that had been cited more than once.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This latest revision gives us a </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">wish list comprised of 1.5M ISBNs</span>](https://archive.org/details/open_libraries_wish_list)<span style="font-weight: 400"> that we feel confident in using as a core collection around which to focus our acquisition and digitization priorities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">How can you help?</span>
-------------------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400">If you’d like to help us build our digital collection, you can contribute in the following ways:</span>

-   **Donate books**
    -   <span style="font-weight: 400">You can donate books to our physical archive. If you are a library, a publisher, or have a private collection with more than 1,000 books to donate, please contact Chris Freeland, Director of Open Libraries, at </span><span style="font-weight: 400">chrisfreeland@archive.org</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. We will add these books to our digitization queue and they will become ebooks available through Open Libraries as funding becomes available.</span>
-   **Identify books**
    -   <span style="font-weight: 400">If you are an author who would like to add your own books to the list, you can donate physical copies, and/or contact us to let us know you’d like us to ensure that your work will be preserved and available to future generations. </span>
    -   <span style="font-weight: 400">If you’re a librarian, educator, or other book lover and would like to help us continue to curate the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">wish list</span>](https://archive.org/details/open_libraries_wish_list)<span style="font-weight: 400"> to ensure that it includes the most useful, important and culturally diverse books, please reach out to us.</span>
-   **Scan books**
    -   <span style="font-weight: 400">If you have books on our </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">wish list</span>](https://archive.org/details/open_libraries_wish_list)<span style="font-weight: 400"> but don’t want to donate them to our physical archive, we offer </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">scanning services</span>](https://archive.org/details/partnerdocs)<span style="font-weight: 400"> and can digitize your books in one of our regional scanning centers.</span>

[Let’s Build a Great Digital Library Together…Starting with a Wishlist](https://blog.archive.org/2018/03/14/lets-build-a-great-digital-library-together-starting-with-a-wishlist/)
==================================================================================================================================================================================

Posted on [March 14, 2018](https://blog.archive.org/2018/03/14/lets-build-a-great-digital-library-together-starting-with-a-wishlist/ "5:54 pm")<span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/chrisfreeland/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by chrisfreeland">chrisfreeland</a></span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">We are looking for partners to help us build a great physical collection of books to be preserved, digitized, and made available through our </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">Open Libraries</span>](http://openlibraries.online)<span style="font-weight: 400"> project. Working with more than 500 library partners, the Internet Archive has already helped make more than 3 million public domain books available online for free access through </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">archive.org</span>](https://www.archive.org)<span style="font-weight: 400">. We have also brought more than 500,000 in-copyright books online to provide full access to those with print disabilities. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Our goal is to bring 4 million more books online, so that all digital learners have access to a great digital library on par with a major metropolitan public library system. We know we won’t be able to make this vision a reality alone, which is why we’re working with libraries, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">authors</span>](http://blog.archive.org/2016/10/22/authors-alliance-and-internet-archive-team-up-to-make-books-available/)<span style="font-weight: 400">, and </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">publishers</span>](https://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/mit-press-announces-new-collaboration)<span style="font-weight: 400"> to build a collaborative digital collection accessible to any library in the country. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Building a great library starts with great books. We have already gathered more than 1.5 million books in our </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">physical archive</span>](https://blog.archive.org/2011/05/12/physical-archive-launch/)<span style="font-weight: 400">. We aspire to have one copy of every book, but enroute to that dream we have created  a “</span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">wishlist</span>](https://archive.org/details/open_libraries_wish_list)<span style="font-weight: 400">” to help prioritize preservation and access. This </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">wishlist</span>](https://archive.org/details/open_libraries_wish_list)<span style="font-weight: 400"> was compiled using data and assistance from several great projects:</span>

-   <span style="font-weight: 400">OCLC’s list of </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">one million most widely held books</span>](https://www.oclc.org/en/news/releases/2012/201252.html)<span style="font-weight: 400">, based on holdings records of libraries worldwide; </span>
-   [<span style="font-weight: 400">Library Link</span>](http://library.link/)<span style="font-weight: 400">’s holdings records of North American libraries, leveraging the decisions of thousands of librarians in prioritizing collections for patron use;</span>

[**Download the wishlist here.**](https://archive.org/details/open_libraries_wish_list)

<span style="font-weight: 400">We are using these datasets to help define a collection of books that has wide appeal and impact for libraries across the US and the patrons they serve. This </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">wishlist</span>](https://archive.org/details/open_libraries_wish_list)<span style="font-weight: 400"> is a work-in-progress and will evolve as we incorporate more datasets and review our approach with community input. We’ve made 3 versions our wishlist available to help facilitate use within the library and publishing communities, featuring </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">ISBN-13</span>](https://archive.org/download/open_libraries_wish_list)<span style="font-weight: 400">, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">ISBN-10</span>](https://archive.org/download/open_libraries_wish_list)<span style="font-weight: 400">, & </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">OCLC</span>](https://archive.org/download/open_libraries_wish_list)<span style="font-weight: 400"> identifiers.</span>

**Here’s how you can help!**<span style="font-weight: 400"> We are looking for libraries, authors, publishers, and individual book lovers to help us build this collection. You can help in the following ways:</span>

[The 20th Century Time Machine](https://blog.archive.org/2017/10/13/the-20th-century-time-machine/)
===================================================================================================

Posted on [October 13, 2017](https://blog.archive.org/2017/10/13/the-20th-century-time-machine/ "2:24 am")<span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/nancyw/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by Nancy Watzman">Nancy Watzman</a></span></span>

*by Nancy Watzman & Katie Dahl*

<img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1U6A5264-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jason Scott" class="size-large wp-image-14971 aligncenter" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1U6A5264-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1U6A5264-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1U6A5264-768x512.jpg 768w" width="640" height="427" />

With the turn of a dial, some flashing lights, and the requisite puff of fog, emcees Tracey Jaquith, TV Architect, and Jason Scott, Free Range Archivist, cranked up the Internet Archive 20th Century Time Machine on stage before a packed house at the Internet Archive’s annual party on October 11.

Eureka! The cardboard contraption worked! The year was 1912, and out stepped Alexis Rossi, director of Media and Access, her hat adorned with a 78rpm record.

1912

<img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dannaalexander.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-14972" sizes="(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dannaalexander.jpg 308w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dannaalexander-300x267.jpg 300w" width="308" height="274" />

“Close your eyes and listen,” Rossi asked the audience. And then, out of the speakers floated the scratchy sounds of Billy Murray singing [“Low Bridge, Everybody Down”](http://allen_gbia0015535b/) written by Thomas S. Allen. From 1898 to the 1950s, some three million recordings of about three minutes each were made on 78rpm discs. But these discs are now brittle, the music stored on them precious. The Internet Archive is working with partners on the [Great 78 Project](http://great78.archive.org/) to store these recordings digitally, so that we and future generations can enjoy them and reflect on our music history. New collections include the [Tina Argumedo and Lucrecia Hug 78rpm Collection](https://archive.org/details/argumedo-hug) of dance music collected in Argentina in the mid-1930s.

1927
----

Next to emerge from the Time Machine was [David Leonard](https://www.boston.gov/departments/library/david-leonard), president of the Boston Public Library, which was the first free, municipal library founded in the United States. The mission was and remains bold: make knowledge available to everyone. Knowledge shouldn’t be hidden behind paywalls, restricted to the wealthy but rather should operate under the principle of open access as public good, he explained. Leonard announced that the Boston Public Library would join the Internet Archive’s Great 78 Project, by authorizing the transfer of 200,000 individual 78s and LPs to preserve and make accessible to the public, “a collection that otherwise would remain in storage unavailable to anyone.”

<img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1U6A5139-300x200.jpg" class="size-medium wp-image-14977" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1U6A5139-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1U6A5139-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1U6A5139-1024x683.jpg 1024w" width="300" height="200" />

David Leonard and Brewster Kahle

Brewster Kahle, founder and Digital Librarian of the Internet Archive, then came through the time machine to present the Internet Archive Hero Award to Leonard. “I am inspired every time I go through the doors,” said Kahle of the library, noting that the Boston Public Library was the first to digitize not just a presidential library, of John Quincy Adams, but also modern books.  Leonard was presented with a tablet imprinted with the Boston Public Library homepage by Internet Archive 2017 Artist in Residence, Jeremiah Jenkins.

1942
----

Kahle then set the Time Machine to 1942 to explain another new Internet Archive initiative: [liberating books](http://blog.archive.org/2017/10/10/books-from-1923-to-1941-now-liberated/) published between 1923 to 1941. Working with [Elizabeth Townsend Gard](http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlsfaculty/profiles.aspx?id=2116), a copyright scholar at Tulane University, the Internet Archive is liberating these books under a little known, and perhaps never used, provision of US copyright law, Section [108h,](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/108) which allows libraries to scan and make available materials published 1923 to 1941 if they are not being actively sold. The name of the new collection: the [Sony Bono Memorial Collection](https://archive.org/details/last20&tab=about), named for the now deceased congressman and former representative who led the passage of the [Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act), which included the 108h provision as a “gift” to libraries.

One of these books includes “[Your Life](https://archive.org/details/yourlifepopularg21lurtrich),” a tome written by Kahle’s grandfather, Douglas E. Lurton, a “guide to a desirable living.” “I have one copy of this book and two sons. According to the law, I can’t make one copy and give it to the other son. But now it’s available,” Kahle explained.

1944

Sab Masada

The Time Machine cranked to 1944, out came Rick Prelinger, Internet Archive Board member, archivist, and filmmaker. Prelinger introduced a new addition to the Internet Archive’s film collection: [long-forgotten footage of an Arkansas Japanese internment camp from 1944.](https://archive.org/details/010114Jerome_201710)  As the film played on the screen, Prelinger welcomed Sab Masada, 87, who lived at this very camp as a 12-year-old.

Masada talked about his experience at the camp and why it is important for people today to remember it. “Since the election I’ve heard echoes of what I heard in 1942,” Masada said. “Using fear of terrorism to target the Muslims and people south of the border.”

1972
----

Next to speak was Wendy Hanamura, the director of partnerships. Hanamura explained how as a sixth grader she discovered a book at the library, [*Executive Order 9066*](https://archive.org/details/executiveorder9000conr), published in 1972, which chronicled photos of Japanese internment camps during World War II.

“Before I was an internet archivist, I was a daughter and granddaughter of American citizens who were locked up behind barbed wire in the same kind of camps that incarcerated Sab,” said Hanamura. That one book – now out of print – helped her understand what had happened to her family.

Inspired by making it to the [semi-final round](https://www.macfound.org/press/press-releases/semi-finalists-named-macarthur-competition-100-million-grant/) of the MacArthur *100&Change* initiative with a proposal that provides libraries and learners with free digital access to four million books, the Internet Archive is forging ahead with plans, despite not winning the $100 million grant. Among the books the Internet Archive is making available: *Executive Order 9066*.

The year display turned to 1985, Jason Scott reappeared on stage, explaining his role as a software curator. New this year to the Internet Archive are collections of early Apple software, he explained, with browser emulation allowing the user to experience just what it was like to fire up a Macintosh computer back in its hay day. This includes a [collection](https://archive.org/details/hypercardstacks) of the then wildly popular “[HyperCards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard),” a programmatic tool that enabled users to create programs that linked materials in creative ways, before the rise of the world wide web.

1997

After <img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1U6A5310-200x300.jpg" alt="Vinay Goel" class="alignleft wp-image-14980 size-medium" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1U6A5310-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1U6A5310-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1U6A5310-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1U6A5310.jpg 2000w" width="200" height="300" />this tour through the 20th century, the Time Machine was set to 1997. Mark Graham, Director of the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) and Vinay Goel, Senior Data Engineer, stepped on stage. Back in 1997, when the Wayback Machine began archiving websites on the still new World Wide Web, the entire thing amounted to 2.2 terabytes of data. Now the Wayback Machine contains 20 petabytes. Graham explained how the Wayback Machine is preserving tweets, government websites, and other materials that could otherwise vanish. One example: [this report](https://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20161217_050000_The_Rachel_Maddow_Show/start/3002/end/3053.8) from The Rachel Maddow Show, which aired on December 16, 2016, about [Michael Flynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Flynn), then slated to become National Security Advisor. Flynn deleted a tweet he had made linking to a falsified story about Hillary Clinton, but the Internet Archive saved it through the Wayback Machine.

Goel took the microphone to announce new improvements to Wayback Machine Search 2.0. Now it’s possible to search for keywords, such as “climate change,” and find not just web pages from a particular time period mentioning these words, but also different format types — such as images, pdfs, or yes, even an old Internet Archive favorite, animated gifs from the now-defunct GeoCities–including snow globes!

Thanks to all who came out to celebrate with the Internet Archive staff and volunteers, or watched online. Please join our efforts to provide Universal Access to All Knowledge, whatever century it is from.

We are pleased to announce that the Internet Archive and [OCLC](http://www.oclc.org/en/about.html) have agreed to synchronize the metadata describing our digital books with OCLC’s WorldCat. [WorldCat](https://www.worldcat.org/) is a union catalog that itemizes the collections of thousands of libraries in more than 120 countries that participate in the OCLC global cooperative.

**What does this mean for readers?  
**When the synchronization work is complete, library patrons will be able to discover the Internet Archive’s collection of 2.5 million digitized monographs through the libraries around the world that use OCLC’s bibliographic services. Readers searching for a particular volume will know that a digital version of the book exists in our collection. With just one click, readers will be taken to archive.org to examine and possibly borrow the digital version of that book. In turn, readers who find a digital book at archive.org will be able, with one click, to discover the nearest library where they can borrow the hard copy.

There are additional benefits: in the process of the synchronization, OCLC databases will be enriched with records describing books that may not yet be represented in WorldCat.

“This work strengthens the Archive’s connection to the library community around the world. It advances our goal of universal access by making our collections much more widely discoverable. It will benefit library users around the globe by giving them the opportunity to borrow digital books that might not otherwise be available to them,” said Brewster Kahle, Founder and Digital Librarian of the Internet Archive. “We’re glad to partner with OCLC to make this possible and look forward to other opportunities this synchronization will present.”

“OCLC is always looking for opportunities to work with partners who share goals and objectives that can benefit libraries and library users,” said Chip Nilges, OCLC Vice President, Business Development. “We’re excited to be working with Internet Archive, and to make this valuable content discoverable through WorldCat. This partnership will add value to WorldCat, expand the collections of member libraries, and extend the reach of Internet Archive content to library users everywhere.”

We believe this partnership will be a win-win-win for libraries and for learners around the globe.

Better discovery, richer metadata, more books borrowed and read.

[Books from 1923 to 1941 Now Liberated!](https://blog.archive.org/2017/10/10/books-from-1923-to-1941-now-liberated/)

The Internet Archive is now leveraging a little known, and perhaps never used, provision of US copyright law, Section [108h,](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/108) which allows libraries to scan and make available materials published 1923 to 1941 if they are not being actively sold. [Elizabeth Townsend Gard](http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlsfaculty/profiles.aspx?id=2116), a copyright scholar at Tulane University calls this “[Library Public Domain](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3049158).”  She and her students helped bring the [first scanned books of this era available online](https://archive.org/details/last20) in a collection named for the author of the bill making this necessary: [The Sonny Bono Memorial Collection](https://archive.org/details/last20). Thousands more books will be added in the near future as we automate. We hope this will encourage libraries that have been reticent to scan beyond 1923 to start mass scanning their books and other works, at least up to 1942.

While good news, it is too bad it is necessary to use this provision.

Trend of Maximum U.S. General Copyright Term by Tom W Bell

If the Founding Fathers had their way, almost all works from the 20th century would be public domain by now ([14-year copyright term](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Founders_Copyright), renewable once if you took extra actions).

Some corporations saw adding works to the public domain to be a problem, and when Sonny Bono [got elected](https://web.archive.org/web/19970811123301/http://www.house.gov:80/bono/welcome.htm) to the House of Representatives, representing Riverside County, near Los Angeles, he helped push through [a law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act) extending copyright’s duration another 20 years to keep things locked-up back to 1923.  This has been called the [Mickey Mouse Protection Act](http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/uclalr48&div=35&id=&page=) due to one of the motivators behind the law, <span style="font-weight: 400;">but it was also a result of Europe extending copyright terms an additional twenty years first</span>. If not for this law, works from 1923 and beyond would have been in the public domain decades ago.

Lawrence Lessig

Creative Commons founder, Larry Lessig [fought the new law in court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft) as unreasonable, unneeded, and ridiculous.  In support of Lessig’s fight, the Internet Archive made an [Internet bookmobile](https://archive.org/texts/bookmobile.php) to celebrate what could be done with the public domain. We drove the bookmobile across the country to the Supreme Court to make books during the hearing of the case. Alas, we lost.

<img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/bookmobile-cropped-1-300x262.jpg" class="size-medium wp-image-14907" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/bookmobile-cropped-1-300x262.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/bookmobile-cropped-1-768x672.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/bookmobile-cropped-1-1024x896.jpg 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/bookmobile-cropped-1.jpg 1167w" width="300" height="262" />

Internet Archive Bookmobile in front of  
Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh: “Free to the People”

But there is an exemption from this extension of copyright, but only for libraries and only for works that are not actively for sale — we can scan them and make them available. Professor Townsend Gard had two legal interns work with the Internet Archive last summer to find how we can automate finding appropriate scanned books that could be liberated, and hand-vetted the first books for the collection. Professor Townsend Gard has just released an in-depth [paper](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3049158) giving libraries guidance as to how to implement Section 108(h) based on her work with the Archive and other libraries. T<span style="font-weight: 400;">ogether, we have called them “Last Twenty” Collections, as libraries and archives can copy and distribute to the general public qualified works in the last twenty years of their copyright.  </span>

Today we announce the “[Sonny Bono Memorial Collection](https://archive.org/details/last20)” containing the first books to be liberated. Anyone can download, read, and enjoy these works that have been long out of print. We will add another 10,000 books and other works in the near future. <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Working with the Internet Archive has allowed us to do the work to make this part of the law usable,” reflected Professor Townsend Gard. “Hopefully, this will be the first of many “Last Twenty” Collections around the country.”</span>

Now it is the chance for libraries and citizens who have been reticent to scan works beyond 1923, to push forward to 1941, and the Internet Archive will host them. “I’ve always said that the silver lining of the unfortunate *Eldred v. Ashcroft* decision was the response from people to do something, to actively begin to limit the power of the copyright monopoly through action that promoted open access and CC licensing,” says Carrie Russell, Director of ALA’s Program of Public Access to Information. “As a result, the academy and the general public has rediscovered the value of the public domain. The Last Twenty project joins the Internet Archive, the HathiTrust copyright review project, and the Creative Commons in amassing our public domain to further new scholarship, creativity, and learning.”

We thank and congratulate Team Durationator and Professor Townsend Gard for all the hard work that went into making this new collection possible. Professor Townsend Gard, along with her husband, Dr. Ron Gard, have started a company, [Limited Times](http://www.limitedtimes.com/), to assist libraries, archives, and museums implementing Section 108(h), “Last Twenty” collections, and other aspects of the copyright law.
