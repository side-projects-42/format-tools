<p>Looking around your home in the new year and wondering what to do with all the stuff you’ve accumulated? You’re not alone — turns out <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/survey-finds-54-percent-of-americans-are-overwhelmed-with-clutter-and-dont-know-what-to-do-with-it-300019518.html">54% of Americans are overwhelmed</a> by the amount of clutter around them. As people move or downsize, they are often in a dilemma about what to do with their beloved books and records. The same goes for colleges and libraries when they close or relocate. So what’s a preservation-minded person or organization supposed to do with their extra books, records, or other media?</p>
<p>The Internet Archive is here to help! We <a href="https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360017876312-How-do-I-make-a-physical-donation-to-the-Internet-Archive-">welcome donations with open arms</a> — from single books to entire libraries. The Internet Archive seeks to preserve and digitize one copy of every book, record, CD, film, and microfilm in support of our mission to provide “Universal Access to All Knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Increasingly, people are turning to the Internet Archive to preserve materials and give them new life online,” said Liz Rosenberg, donation manager. “Staff members can even help to arrange for a convenient pick up of larger donations.” </p>
<p> “We are always looking for items that we don’t have already or ones that are in better shape,” said Rosenberg, who encourages people to check <a href="http://www.archive.org/">online</a>, if convenient, if a copy is needed. For large collections or donations with special circumstances, Internet Archive will go onsite to pack and ship items at no expense to the donor. “Our goal is to make this process easy for donors.”</p>
<p>Internet Archive receives a variety of materials from individuals and organizations. <a href="https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360017876312-How-do-I-make-a-physical-donation-to-the-Internet-Archive-">Boxes can be mailed</a> to facilities in Richmond, California, or brought to drop off locations in the U.S. and England. The Archive tries to digitize materials and make them available publicly, as funding allows. </p>
<p>Recent personal donations have included a collection of railroad maps and atlases from the 1800s. Also, a large collection of fragile 78rpm records was donated by a person in Washington, D.C., and 18,000 LP, 45, and 78 records were donated from a home in Arkansas.</p>
<p>Some recent institutional donations include <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/09/28/evangelical-seminary-decides-digital-library-is-best-for-students/">80,000 books from the Evangelical Seminary</a>, <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/09/09/hope-international-universitys-journals-get-new-digital-life/">191 boxes of journals and periodicals from Hope International University</a>, and <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/10/20/digitization-saves-marygrove-college-library-after-closure/">70,000 books, journals and microfilm from Marygrove College</a>. These larger gifts are made into special collections to help Internet Archive users find the materials and celebrate the donor.</p>
<p>We are happy to give donors a receipt for tax purposes and celebrate the donation on the archive.org site if appropriate. </p>
<p>“We would love to provide a forever home for your media wherever you are located, however much you have,” said Rosenberg. “I love doing this role. It restores my faith in the goodness of the world every day.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.discogs.com">Discogs</a> has cracked the nut, struck the right balance, and is therefore an absolute Internet treasure– Thank you.</p>
<p>If you don’t know them, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discogs">Discogs</a> is a central resource for the LP/78/CD music communities, and as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discogs">Wikipedia</a> said “As of 28 August 2019 Discogs contained over 11.6 million releases, by over 6 million artists, across over 1.3 million labels, contributed from over 456,000 contributor user accounts—with these figures constantly growing…”</p>
<p>When I met the founder, Kevin Lewandowski, a year ago he said the Portland based company supports 80 employees and is growing. They make money by being a <a href="https://thequietus.com/articles/24529-discogs-more-than-200-million-dollars">marketplace</a> for buyers and sellers of discs.  An LP dealer I met in Oklahoma sells most of his discs through discogs as well as going at record fairs.</p>
<p>The data about records is spectacularly clean. Compare it to Ebay, where the data is scattershot, and you have something quite different and reusable. It is the best parts of <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">musicbrainz</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDDB">CDDB</a>, and Ebay– where users can catalog their collections and buy/sell records. By starting with the community function, Kevin said, the quality started out really good, and then adding the market place later led it to its success.</p>
<p>But there is something else Discogs does that sets it apart from many other commercial websites, and this makes All The Difference:</p>
<p>Discogs also makes their data available, <a href="https://data.discogs.com/">in bulk</a>, and with a <a href="https://www.discogs.com/developers">free-to-use API</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://great78.archive.org/">Great 78 Project</a> has leveraged this bulk database to help find the date of release for 78’s.  Just yesterday, I downloaded the new dataset and added it to our 78rpm date database, and in last year 10’s of thousands more 78’s were added to discogs, and we found 1,500 more dates for our existing 78’s.   Thank you!</p>
<p>The Internet Archive <a href="https://twitter.com/lostvinyl_ia">Lost Vinyl Project</a> leverages the API’s by looking up records we will be digitizing to find track listings.</p>
<p>A donor to our CD project used the public price information to appraise the CDs he donated for a tax write-off.</p>
<p>We want to add links back from Discogs to the Internet Archive and they have not allowed that yet (please please), but there is always something more to do.</p>
<p>I hope other sites, even commercial ones, would allow bulk access to their data (an API is not enough).   </p>
<p>Thank you, Discogs.</p>

<p>We have been digitizing about 8,000 78rpm record sides each month and now have 122,000 of them done. These have been <a href="https://archive.org/details/georgeblood">posted on the net</a> and over a million people have explored them. We have been digitizing, typing the information on the label, and linking to other information like discographies, databases, reviews and the like.</p>
<p>Volunteers, users, and internal QA checkers have pointing out typos, and we decided to go back over a couple of month’s metadata and found problems. And then we contracted with professional proofreaders and they found even more (2% of the records at this point had something to point out, some are matters of opinion or aesthetics, some lead to corrections).</p>
<p>We are going to pay the professional proofreaders to correct the 5 most important fields for all 122,000 records, but can use more help. We are pointing these out here in hopes to interest volunteer proofreaders and to share our experience in continually improving our collections.</p>
<p>Here are some of the issues with the primary performer field: before-the-after that we have now corrected from the June 2019 transfers (before | after) that we hope to upload in the next couple of weeks:</p>
<p>Jose Melis And His Latin American Ensemble | Jose Melis And His-Latin American Ensemble<br />

<p>Good news: we have funding to preserve at least another 250,000 sides of 78rpm records, and we are looking for donations to digitize and physically preserve. We try to do a good job of digitizing and <a href="https://archive.org/details/georgeblood">hosting the recordings</a> and then thousands of people listen, learn, and enjoy these fabulous recordings.  </p>
<p>If you have 78s (or other recordings) that you would like to find a good home for, please think of us — we are a non-profit and your donations will be tax-deductible, digitized for all to hear, and physically preserved. If you are interested in donating recordings of any type or appropriate books, please start with <a href="https://tiny.cc/musicdonationform">this form</a> and we will contact you immediately</p>
<p>We are looking for anything we do not already have. (We are finding 80% duplication rates sometimes, so we are trying to find larger or more niche collections).  We will physically preserve all genres, but our current funding has directed us to prioritize digitization of non-classical and non-opera.</p>
<p>We can pay for packing and shipping, and are getting better at the logistics for collections of a few thousand and up.  These are fragile objects and we are having good luck avoiding damage.</p>

<p>The collections get highlighted and if you submit a story we will post it prominently. For instance: <a href="https://archive.org/details/78rpm_bostonpubliclibrary">Boston Public Library</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/78rpm_mcneil">Daniel McNeil</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/argumedo-hug">Tina Argumedo’s</a> Argentinian Tango collection.</p>
<p>The reason to highlight the donors is twofold: one is the celebrate the donor and their story, but the other is to help contextualize these recordings for different generations. These stories help users find meaning in the materials and find things they want to listen to. This way we can lead new listeners to love this music as the original collectors have</p>
<p>Working together we can broaden this collection to works from around the world and different cultural groups in each country.</p>
<p>If you are a private individual or an institution and have records to contribute, even if they are not 78s, please start with this <a href="https://tiny.cc/musicdonationform">simple form</a>, or email <a href="mailto:info@archive.org" class="email">info@archive.org</a>, or call +1-415-561-6767 and we will contact you immediately.

<p>Commercial radio broadcasting began in the 1920s, bringing entertainment, news and music into people’s homes. Now, instead of needing to play a 78rpm disc on your phonograph, you could just tune in to listen to popular songs.</p>
<p>And in 1923 that means you would have been listening to one of the many versions of “<a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=title%3A%22yes%20we%20have%20no%20bananas%22&amp;and%5B%5D=year%3A%221923%22">Yes!

<p>In the news of the day you saw the first flight of an <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=autogyro">autogyro</a> (the precursor to the helicopter).</p>

<p>But why are we focusing on 1923? Because for the first time in 20 years, new works are entering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a> in the United States (read more: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/02/the-drought-is-over-mass-us-copyright-expiry-brings-flood-of-works-into-public-domain?fbclid=IwAR0XcvzFcDQG0kV3N6Fjnd5NhiyM7U7mjVMQhDLvbBGPFhiRUpNEliyHhKc">1,</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/books/copyright-extension-literature-public-domain.html">2</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/12/30/680994544/on-jan-1-books-movies-and-music-from-1923-enter-public-domain">3)</a>. And those works were all published in, you guessed it, 1923.</p>
<p>Settle in with a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup, a Butterfinger, or a refreshing Popsicle (all invented in 1923!) while you watch Cecil B. DeMille’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/ptp_the-ten-commandments_cecil-b-demille_blu-ray_x264_mkv_720p_180770">The Ten Commandments</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/ptp_the-white-sister_henry-king_dvd_x264_mkv_716x480_252423">The White Sister</a> starring Lillian Gish, or <a href="https://archive.org/details/The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</a> starring Lon Chaney.

<p>After your movie marathon, you can turn to your “new” reading materials to learn about <a href="https://archive.org/details/abcofdressbyharr00coll">sewing the latest women’s fashions</a>, try an old recipe from a <a href="https://archive.org/details/texts?and%5B%5D=date%3A1923*+AND+%22cook+book%22">cook book</a> (we recommend the <a href="https://archive.org/details/lordsalisburycha00impe/page/98">Marshmallow Loaf</a>), learn about <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheatreLightingPastAndPresent">theatrical lighting</a>, construct yourself a <a href="https://archive.org/details/BungalowHomesTheWorldsMostPopularPlanBook">bungalow</a> (um, check the lastest building codes first), grab some <a href="https://archive.org/details/texts?and%5B%5D=date%3A1923*+AND+score&amp;sin=&amp;sort=-downloads">sheet music</a>, read up on <a href="https://archive.org/details/texts?and%5B%5D=date%3A1923*+AND+benito+mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>, and learn “<a href="https://archive.org/details/HowYouCanKeepFitByRudolphValentino/page/n1">How You Can Keep Fit</a>” from Rudolph Valentino (!).</p>

<p>As part of our end-of-year fundraising drive, I thought it might be fun to tweet highlighted parts of the vast stacks of content that the Internet Archive makes available for free to millions. A lot of folks know about our <a href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> and its 20+ years of website history, but there’s petabytes of media and works available to see throughout the site. I called it “30 Days of Stuff”, and for the last 30 days I’ve been pointing out great items at the Archive, once a day.</p>
<p>You won’t have to swim upstream through my tweets; here on the last day, I’ve compiled the highlighted items in this entry. Enjoy these jewels in the Archive’s collection, a small sample of the wide range of items we provide.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303-199x300.jpg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15676" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303-199x300.jpg 199w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303-678x1024.jpg 678w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/303.jpg 720w" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Books and Texts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.org/details/thelatchkey01millarch">The Latch Key of my Bookhouse</a> was one of the first books scanned by the Internet Archive in its book scanner tests, and it’s a 1921 directory of Children’s Literature that is filled with really nice illustrations that came out great.</li>
<li>As part of our ever-growing set of Defense Technical Information Center collection, we have <a href="https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA055327">The Role of the Citizens Band Radio Service and Travelers Information Stations In Civil Preparedness Emergencies Final Report</a>, a 1978 overview of CB Radio and what role it might play in civil emergencies. Many thousands of taxpayer-funded educational and defense items are mirrored in this collection.</li>
<li>Also in the DTIC collection is <a href="https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA095145">The Battalion Commander’s Handbook 1980</a>, which besides the crazy front page of stamps, approvals and sign-offs, is basically a manager’s handbook written from the point of view of the US Army.</li>
<li>There are <a href="https://archive.org/details/tractormanuals">hundreds of tractor manuals</a> at the Archive. Hundreds! Of all types, languages (a lot of them Russian) and level of information. Tractors are one of those tools that can last generations and keeping the maintenance on them in the field can make a huge difference in livelihood.</li>
<li>A lovely 1904 catalog for plums called <a href="https://archive.org/details/CAT31286852">The Maynard Plum Catalogue</a> was scanned in with one of our partner organizations and it’s a breathless and inspiring declaration of the future wonder of the plums this wizard of plum-growing, Luther Burbank, was bringing to the world.</li>
<li>Xerox Corporation released “<a href="https://archive.org/details/TNM_Coloring_Book_A_metamorphosis_of_creative_cop_20170922_0699">A Metamorphosis of Creative Copying</a>” in 1964, which seems to function as both promotion for Xerox and a weird gift to give to your kids to color in.</li>
<li>In 2014, a short zine called <a href="https://archive.org/details/TaoOfBitcoinIssue1">The Tao of Bitcoin</a> was released, telling people the dream of $10,000 bitcoin would be real.</li>
<li>The 1888 chapbook <a href="https://archive.org/details/goodytwoshoes00newyiala">Goody Two-Shoes</a> has lovely illustrations, and a fine short story.</li>
<li>Working with a lovely couple who brought in a <a href="https://archive.org/details/The_Official_Negro_Directory_and_Classified_Buyers_Guide_1942-1943">1942 black-owned-businesses directory</a>, I scanned the pages by hand and put them up into this item.</li>
<li>Inside that directory was an ad for a school of whistling that said it taught using the methods of Agnes Woodward, and a quick scan of the Archive’s stacks showed that we had an entire copy of her book <a href="https://archive.org/details/WhistlingAsAnArt">Whistling as an Art</a>!</li>
<li>The medical treatise <a href="https://archive.org/details/sleepitsderangem00hamm">Sleep and Its Derangements</a>, from 1869, is William A. Hammond, MD’s overview of sleep, and what can go wrong. Scanned from the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine, it’s one of many thousands of books we’ve scanned with partners.</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.org/details/lethartmanfeathe00hart">Let Hartman Feather Your Nest</a> could be described as “A furniture catalog” in the same way the Sistine Chapel could be described as “a place of worship”. The catalog is a thundering, fist-pounding declaration of the superiority of the Hartman enterprise and the quality and breadth of furniture and service that will arrive at your door and be backed up to the far reaches of time.</li>

<p><strong>Magazines</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Photoplay considered itself <em>the</em> magazine for the motion picture industry in the first part of the 20th century, and this <a href="https://archive.org/details/phodec21chic">multi-volume compilation</a> of photos, articles and advertisements is a truly lovely overview.</li>
<li>There’s over <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=maximum%20collection%3Azines">140 issues of the classic Maximum RockNRoll zine</a>, truly the king of music zines for a very long time. On its newsprint pages are howls and screeches of all manner of punk, rock and the needs of musicians.</li>
<li>A magazine created by the Walt Disney Company to trumpet various parts of Disneyland and its attractions was called Vacationland, and this <a href="https://archive.org/details/VacationlandFall1965">Fall 1965 issue</a> covers all sorts of stuff about the park’s first decade.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/304.jpg"><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/304-300x204.jpg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15678" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/304-300x204.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/304.jpg 574w" width="300" height="204" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Movies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rescued from a warehouse years ago, a collection of Hollywood movie “B-Roll”, unused secondary scenes often filmed by different crew, has been digitized. My personal favorite is <a href="https://archive.org/details/PET1034_R-4">[Western Film Scenes]</a>, which is circa 1950s footage of a Western Town, all of it utterly fake but feeling weirdly real, to be used in a western. Don’t miss everyone standing around looking right at you and looking like they agree quite energetically with you!</li>
<li>No compilation could be complete without the legendary <a href="https://archive.org/details/DuckandC1951">Duck and Cover</a>, a cartoon/PSA that explained the simple ways to avoid injury in a nuclear blast. Just lie down! It’ll be fine. Please note: This Probably Won’t Work. But the song is very catchy.</li>
<li>The very weird <a href="https://archive.org/details/The_Electric-Film_Format_Acid_Test_1990">Electric Film Format Acid Test</a> from 1990 has a semi-interested model holding up a color bar plate in a wide, wide variety of film and video formats. Filmed just a few blocks away from the Internet Archive’s current headquarters.</li>
<li>I snuck in a <a href="https://archive.org/details/brewster_kahle_interview_1992">1992 interview with the Archive’s founder, Brewster Kahle</a>, back when he was 33 and working at WAIS, a company or two before the Archive and where he is asked about his thoughts on information and gathering of data. It’s quite interesting to hear the consistency of thought.</li>
<li>The Office of War Information worked with Disney to create “<a href="https://archive.org/details/DentalHealth1945">Dental Health</a>“, a film to show to troops about proper dental care. It’s a combination of straightforward animation and industrial film-making worth enjoying.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Audio</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have a collection of hours of the radio show <a href="https://archive.org/details/RkoOrsonWelles-TheShadow-RadioRecodings">The Shadow</a> from 1938-1939, starring  Orson Welles at 23, at the height of his performance powers, playing the dual main role.</li>
<li>For Christmas Eve, we pointed to <a href="https://archive.org/details/78_christmas-chopsticks-twas-the-night-before-christmas_fred-heider-bobby-burns-pet_gbia0000281b">“Christmas Chopsticks”</a>, a 1953 78rpm record of “Twas the Night Before Christmas” performed to the tune of the classic piano piece “Chopsticks”; one of tens of thousands of 78rpm records the Archive has been adding this year.</li>
<li>On Christmas, a user of the Archive uploaded two obscure albums he’d purchased on eBay – remnants of the S. S. Kresge Company, which became K-Mart, and which were played over the PA system for shoppers.

<p>I believe we can do a fabulous job of bringing the music from the <a href="https://archive.org/details/georgeblood">78rpm era</a> back to <a href="http://great78.archive.org">vibrant life</a> if we really understand wear and if we could model the instruments and voices.</p>
<p>In other words, I believe we could reconstruct a performance by semantically modeling the noise and distortion we want to get rid of, as well as modeling the performer’s instruments.</p>
<p>To follow this reasoning—what if we knew we were examining a piano piece and knew what notes were being played on what kind of piano and <em>exactly</em> when and how hard for each note—we could take that information to make a reconstruction by playing it again and recording that version. This would be similar to what optical character recognition (OCR) does with images of pages with text—it knows the language and it figures out the words on the page and then makes a new page in a perfect font. In fact, with the OCR’ed text, you can change the font, make it bigger, and reflow the page to fit on a different device.</p>
<p>What if we OCR’ed the music? This might work well for the instrumental accompaniment, because then we would handle a voice, if any, differently. We could have a model of the singer’s voice based on not only this recording and other recordings of this song, but also all other recordings of that singer. With those models we could reconstruct the voice without any noise or distortion at all.</p>
<p>We would balance the reconstructed and the raw signals to maintain the subtle variations that make great performances.   This could also be done for context as sometimes digital filmmakers add in some scratched film effects.</p>
<p>So, there can be a wide variety of restoration tools if we make the jump into semantics and big data analysis.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://great78.archive.org/">Great 78 Project</a> will collect and digitize over 400,000 <a href="https://archive.org/details/georgeblood">digitized 78rpm recordings</a> to make them publicly available, creating a rich data set to do large scale analysis. These transfers are being done with four different styli shapes and sizes at the same time, and all recorded at 96KHz/24bit lossless samples, and in stereo (even though the records are in mono, this provides more information about the contours of the groove). This means each groove has 8 different high-resolution representations of every 11 microns. Furthermore, there are often multiple copies of the same recording that would have been stamped and used differently. So, modeling the wear on the record and using that to reconstruct what would have been on the master may be possible.</p>
<p>Many important records from the 20th century, such as jazz, blues, and ragtime, have only a few performers on each, so modeling those performers, instruments, and performances is quite possible.  Analyzing whole corpuses is now easier with modern computers, which can provide insights beyond restoration as well as understand playing techniques that are not commonly understood.</p>
<p>If we build full semantic models of instruments, performers, and pieces of music, we could even create virtual performances that never existed.  Imagine a jazz performer virtually playing a song that had not been written in their lifetime. We could have different musician combinations, or singers performing with different cadences. Areas for experimentation abound once we cross the threshold of full corpus analysis and semantic modeling.</p>
<p>We hope the technical work done on this project will have a far-reaching effect on a full media type since the Great 78 Project will digitize and hold a large percentage of all 78rpm records ever produced from 1908 to 1950.  Therefore, any techniques that are built upon these recordings can be used to restore many many records.</p>
<p>Please <a href="http://great78.archive.org">dive in</a> and have fun with a great era of music and sound.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(we get a sample every 11microns when digitizing the outer rim of a 78rpm record at 96KHz.   And given we now have 8 different readings of that, with 24bit resolution, we hopefully can get a good idea of the groove.   There are optical techniques that are very cool, but those have their own issues, I am told</p>
<p>10″ * 3.14 = 31.4″ circumference = 80cm/revolution</p>
<p>@ 78rpm:  60 seconds/min / 78revolutions/minute = .77 seconds / revolution</p>
<p>80cm/rev   / (.77sec/rev)  = 104cm/sec</p>
<p>96Ksampes/sec</p>
<p>104cm/sec / (96ksamples/sec) = 11microns )</p>

<p><em>By Jessica Thompson, Coast Mastering</em></p>
<p><a href="http://great78.archive.org/">The Great 78 Project<br />
</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few times a year, I join B. George in the Internet Archives’ warehouses to help sort and pack 78rpm discs to ship to George Blood L.P. for digitization. As a music fan and a professional mastering and restoration engineer, I get a thrill from handling the heavy, grooved discs, admiring the fonts and graphic designs on the labels, and chuckling at </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/78_its-drunk-out-tonight_butterball-brown-and-his-orchestra-johnson-butterball-brown_gbia0001255b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amusing song titles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now digitized, these recordings offer a wealth of musicological, discographic and technical information, documenting and contextualizing music and recording history in the first half of the 20th century. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sheer scale of this digitization project is unprecedented. At over 15,000 recordings and counting, the value strictly in terms of preservation is clear, especially given the Internet Archive’s focus on digitizing music less commonly available to researchers. Music fans can take a deep dive into early </span><a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=78rpm&amp;and%5B%5D=collection%3A%22georgeblood%22&amp;and%5B%5D=subject%3A%2278rpm%22&amp;and%5B%5D=subject%3A%22Blues%22&amp;and%5B%5D=subject%3A%22Jump%20Blues%22&amp;and%5B%5D=subject%3A%22Rhythm%20%26%20Blues%22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=78rpm&amp;&amp;and%5B%5D=subject%3A%2278rpm%22&amp;and%5B%5D=collection%3A%22georgeblood%22&amp;and%5B%5D=subject%3A%22Hawaiian%22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawaiian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=78rpm&amp;and%5B%5D=collection%3A%22georgeblood%22&amp;and%5B%5D=subject%3A%2278rpm%22&amp;and%5B%5D=subject%3A%22Hillbilly%22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hillbilly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=78rpm&amp;and%5B%5D=collection%3A%22georgeblood%22&amp;and%5B%5D=subject%3A%2278rpm%22&amp;and%5B%5D=subject%3A%22Comedy%22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comedy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=78rpm&amp;and%5B%5D=collection%3A%22georgeblood%22&amp;and%5B%5D=subject%3A%2278rpm%22&amp;and%5B%5D=subject%3A%22Bluegrass%22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bluegrass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I even found several early</span> <a href="https://archive.org/details/78_parade-of-the-wooden-soldiers_leon-jessel-collins-h.-driggs_gbia0001186a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Novachord</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> synthesizer recordings from 1941.</span></p>
<p>As a researcher and audio restoration engineer, the real goldmine is in the aggregation of discographic and technical metadata accompanying these recordings. Historians can search for and cross reference recordings based on label, artist, song title, year of release, personnel, genre, and, importantly, collection. (The Internet Archive documents the provenance of the 78rpm discs so that donated collections remain digitally intact and maintain their contextual significance.) General users can submit reviews with notes to amend or add to metadata, and the content of those reviews is searchable, so metadata collection is active. No doubt it will continue to improve as dedicated and educated users fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>Access to the technical metadata offers a valuable teaching tool to those of us who practice audio preservation. For audio professionals new to 78s and curious about how much difference a few tenths of a millimeter of stylus can make, the Internet Archive offers 15,000+ examples of this. Play through the different styli options, and it quickly becomes apparent that particular labels, years and even discs do respond better to specific styli sizes and shapes. This is something audio preservationists are taught, but rarely are we presented with comprehensive audio examples. To be able to listen to and analyze the sonic and technical differences in these versions marries the hard science with the aesthetic.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playback speeds were not standardized until the late 1920s or early 1930s, and most discs were originally cut at speeds ranging from 76-80rpm (and some well beyond). The discs in the <a href="https://archive.org/details/georgeblood">George Blood Collection</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were all digitized at a playback speed of 78rpm. Preservationists and collectors debate extensively about the “correct” speed at which discs ought to be played back, and whether one ought to pitch discs individually. However, performance, recording and manufacturing practices varied so widely that even if a base speed could generally be agreed upon, there will always be exceptions. (For more on this, please check out George Blood’s forthcoming paper </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/StylusSizeAndSpeedSelectionInPre1923AcousticRecordings20160923"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stylus Size And Speed Selection In Pre-1923 Acoustic Recordings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sustainable audiovisual collections through collaboration: Proceedings of the 2016 Joint Technical Symposium</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press.)</span></p>
<p>Every step of making a recording involves so many aesthetic decisions – choices of instrumentation, methods of sound amplification, microphone placement, the materials used in the disc itself, deliberate pitching of the instruments and slowing or speeding of the recording – that playback speed simply become one of many aesthetic choices in the chain. As preservationists, we are preserving the disc as an historic record, not attempting to restore or recreate a performance. (Furthermore, speed correction is possible in the digital realm, should anyone want to modify these digital files for their own personal enjoyment).</p>
<p>How do they sound? Each 78rpm disc has an inherent noise fingerprint based on the frequency and dynamic range the format can replicate (limited, compared to contemporary digital playback formats) and the addition of surface noise from dust, dirt and stylus wear in the grooves. As expected, the sound quality in this collection varies. Some of these discs were professionally recorded, minimally played, stored well, and play back with a tolerable, even ignorable level of surface noise relative to the musical content. Others were recorded under less professional circumstances, and/or were much loved, frequently played, stored without sleeves in basements and attics, and therefore suffer from significant surface noise that can interfere with enjoyment (and study) of the music.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, a compelling recording can cut through noise. Take this 1944 recording of Josh White performing </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/78_st.-james-infirmary_josh-white_gbia0001626a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">St. James Infirmary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Asch 358-2A. This side has been released commercially several times, so if you look it up on a streaming service like </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/songfolly/playlist/0fcgYesEIlhPpzX6VGQTQS"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can listen to different versions sourced from the same recording (though almost certainly not from the same 78rpm disc). They play at different speeds, some barely perceptibly faster or slower but at least one nearly a half-step faster than the preservation copy digitized by George Blood L.P. They also have a range of noise reduction and remastering aesthetics, some subtle and some downright ugly and riddled with digital artifacts. The version on the Internet Archive offers a benchmark. This is what the recording sounded like on the original 78rpm disc. Listen to the bend in the opening guitar notes. That technique cuts through the surface noise and should be preserved and highlighted in any </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/StJamesInfirmaryRestoredFullV1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restored</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> version (which is another way of saying that any noise reduction should absolutely </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interfere with the attack and decay of those luscious guitar notes).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGill University professor of Culture and Technology Jonathan Sterne wrote a book – </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/audible_past_sterne"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Audible Past: Cultural Origins of Sound Reproduction</span></em></a><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">that is worth reading for anyone interested in a cultural history of early recording formats, including 78s. As Sterne says, sound fidelity is “ultimately about deciding the values of competing and contending sounds.” So, in listening to digital versions of 78s on the Internet Archive, music fans, researchers, and audio professionals alike engage in a process of renegotiating concepts of acceptable thresholds of noise and what that noise communicates about the circumstances of the recording and its life on a physical disc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, our brains are very good at calibrating to accept different ratios of signal to noise, and, I found, the more I listened to 78rpm recordings on the Internet Archive, the less I was bothered by the inherent noise. Those of us who grew up on CDs or digitally recorded and distributed music are not used to the intrusions of surface noise. However, when listening to historic recordings, we are able to adjust our expectations and process a level of noise that would be ridiculous in contemporary music formats. (Imagine this week’s </span><a href="http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billboard Top 100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> chart topper, Bruno Mars’s “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMivT7MJ41M"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s What I Like</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” with the high and low end rolled off, covered in a sheen of crackles and pops). The fact that these 78rpm recordings </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">sound,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to us, like they were made in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s lets them get away with a different scale of fidelity. The very nature of their historicity gets them off the hook.</span></p>
<p>In analog form, crackles and pops can be mesmerizing, almost like the sound of a crackling fire. However, once digitized, those previously random pops become fixed in time. What may have been enjoyable in analog form becomes a permanent annoyance in digital form. The threshold of acceptable noise levels moves again.</p>
<p>This means that noise associated with recording carriers such as 78rpm discs is almost always preferably to noises introduced in the digital realm through the process of attempted noise reduction. Sound restorationists understand that their job is to follow a sonic Hippocratic oath: do no harm. Though noise reduction tools are widely available, they range in quality (and accordingly in cost), and are merely tools to be used with a light or heavy touch, by experienced or amateur restorationists.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question of whether noise reduction of the Internet Archive’s 78rpm recordings could be partially automated makes my heart palpitate. Though I know from experience that, for example, auto-declickers exist that could theoretically remove a layer of noise from these recordings with minimal interference with the musical signal, I don’t believe the results would be uniformly satisfactory. It is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">so</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> easy to destroy the aura of a recording with overzealous, heavy-handed, cheap, or simply unnecessary noise reduction. Even a gentle touch of an auto-declicker or de-crackler will have widely varying results on different recordings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried this with a sampling of selections from the /</span><a href="https://archive.org/details/georgeblood"><span style="font-weight: 400;">georgeblood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/ collection. I chose eleven songs from different genres and years and ran two different, high quality auto-declickers (the </span><a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/repair-and-edit/rx/rx-advanced.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iZotope RX6 Advanced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> multiband declicker and </span><a href="https://www.cedar-audio.com/products/cedarstudio/cedarstudiodeclick.shtml"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEDAR Audio’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> declick) on the 24bit FLAC files. The results were uneven. Some of the objectively noisier songs, such as Blind Blake’s </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/78_tampa-bound_blind-blake_gbia0001322b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tampa Bound</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Paramount </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">12442-B</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, benefited from having the most egregious surface noises gently scrubbed.<br />
</span></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Tampa-Bound.png" class="size-full wp-image-13371" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Tampa-Bound.png 785w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Tampa-Bound-300x95.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Tampa-Bound-768x243.png 768w" width="785" height="248" /></p>
<p>Tampa Bound Flat Transfer vs Tampa Bound Declicked, Dehissed and Denoised<br />
that’s a lot of noise!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a song with a strong musical presence and mild surface noise such as Trio Schmeed’s </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/78_yodel-cha-cha_trio-shmeed-brown-schmied-don-costa_gbia0001213a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yodel Cha Cha</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ABC-Paramount 9660, actually suffered more from light auto-declicking because the content of the horns and percussive elements registered to the auto-delicker as aberrations from the meat of the signal and were dulled. A pop presents as an aberration across all frequencies. Mapped visually across frequency, time and intensity, it looks like a spike cutting through the waveform. A snare hit looks similar and is therefore likely to be misinterpreted by an auto-declicker unless the threshold at which the declicker deploys is set very carefully.

<p>A lot of things have changed in the last 20 years. A lot of things haven’t. We’ve moved from the tyranny of physical media to the seemingly unlimited possibilities of total digital immersion. We’ve moved from a top down, mega corporate dominated media, to a hyper-fragmented multiverse where any kind of information is accessible within reason (and sometimes without!). The fundamental issue that “memory” and how it responds to the digital etherealization of all aspects of the information economy we inhabit conditions everything we do in this 21st-century culture of post-, post-, post-everything contemporary America. Whether it’s the legions of people who walk the streets with Bluetooth enabled earbuds that allow them to ignore the physical reality of the world around them, or the Pokémon Go hordes playing the world’s largest video game as it’s overlaid on stuff that happens “IRL” (In Real Life) that layer digital role playing over the world: diagnosis is pending. But the fundamental fact is clear: digital archives are more important than ever and how we engage and access the archival material of the past, shapes and molds the way we experience the present and future. Playing with the Archive is a kind of digital analytics of the subconscious impulse to collage. It’s also really fun.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Mnemosyne1.jpg" alt="mnemosyne1" class="wp-image-11934 alignleft" sizes="(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Mnemosyne1.jpg 166w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Mnemosyne1-125x300.jpg 125w" width="237" height="571" />Mnemosyne was the Greek muse who personified memory. She was a Titaness who was the daughter of Uranus (who represented “Sky”), the son and husband of Gaia, Mother Earth. When you break it down, Mnemosyne had a deeply complicated life, and ended up birthing the other muses with her nephew, Zeus. Ancient Greek myth was quite an incestuous place, and every deity had complicated and deeply interwoven histories that added layers and layers of what we would now call “intertextuality.” Look at it this way: a Titaness, Mnemosyne, gave birth to Urania (Muse of Astronomy), Polyhymnia (Muse of hymns,) Melpomene (Muse of tragedy,) Erato (Muse of lyric poetry,) Clio (Muse of history,) Calliope (Muse of epic poetry,) Terpsichore (Muse of dance,) and Euterpe (Muse of music). It’s complicated. Mnemosyne also presided over her own pool in Hades as a counterpoint to the river Lethe, where the dead went to drink to forget their previous life. If you wanted to remember things, you went to Mnemosyne’s pool instead. You had to be clever enough to find it. Otherwise, you’d end up crossing the river under the control of spirits guided by the “helmsman” whose title translates from the Greek term “kybernētēs” across the mythical river into the land of the dead aka Hades. What’s amazing about the wildly “recombinant” logic of this cast of characters is that somehow it became the foundation of our modern methods for naming almost every aspect of digital media — including the term “media.” <em>Media</em>, like the term <em>data</em> is a plural form of a word “appropriated” directly from Latin. But the eerie resonance it has with our era comes into play when we think of the ways “the archive” acts as a downright uncanny reflection site of language and its collision between code and culture.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/neuromancer-William-Gibson.gif" alt="neuromancer-william-gibson" class="alignright wp-image-11935" width="277" height="436" />Until the internet, the term <em>cyber</em> was usually used to measure words about governance and then later evolved to how we look at computers, computer networks, and now things like augmented reality and virtual reality. The term traces back to the word <em>cybernetics</em>, which was popularized by the renowned mathematician Norbert Wiener, founder of Information theory, at MIT. There’s a strange emergent logic that connects the dots here: permutation, wordplay, and above all, the use of borrowed motifs and ahistorical connections between utterly unassociated material. I guess William S. Burroughs was right: the world has become a mega-Cybertron, a place where everything is mixed, cut and paste style, to make new meanings from old. With people like Norbert Wiener, cybernetics usually refers to the study of mechanical and electronic systems designed at heart, to replace human systems. The term “cyberspace” was coined by William Gibson, to reflect the etherealized world of his 1982 classic, <em>Burning Chrome.</em> He used it again as a reference point for <em>Neuromancer,</em> his groundbreaking novel. A great, oft-cited passage gives you a sense how resonant it is with our current time:</p>
<p><em>Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts… a graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding…</em></p>
<p>When the Internet Archive asked me to do a megamix of their archive of recordings from their data files, I was a bit overwhelmed. There’s no way any human being could comb through even the way they’ve documented just the web, let alone the material they have asked people to upload.Where to start? Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s speech inaugurating the internet back when he came up with the term the “Semantic Web?”  The first recordings from Edison? That could be cool. Maybe mix that with GW Bush’s State of the Union speech inaugurating the invasion of Iraq? Why not. Take Hedy Lamar’s original blueprints for spread spectrum “secret communications systems” and mix that with recordings of William S. Burrough and Malcolm X, with a beat made from open source 1920’s jazz and 1950’s New Orleans blues? Why not. Grab some clips of Cory Doctorow talking about the upcoming war on open computing and mix it with Parliament Funkadelic? Sure. Take the first “sound heard around the world,” the telemetry signals guiding the Sputnik satellite as it swirled around planet Earth to become our first orbital artificial moon? Cool. Why not? Take a speech from Margaret Sanger, the woman who started Planned Parenthood, and mix it with Public Enemy? Cool. Take D.W. Griffith’s “Birth of a Nation” and re-score it with the Quincy Jones theme from “Fat Albert?” That would actually be kind of cool, but would require a lot of editing.</p>
<p>The basic idea here is that once you have the recordings and documentation of all aspects of human activity from the last several centuries, <em>that is a serious “mega-mix.”</em></p>
<p>What you will hear in the short track I made is a mini reflection of the density of the sheer volume of materials that the Internet Archive has onsite. It is a humble reminder that through the computer, the network, and the wireless transmission of information, we have an immaculate reflection of what Alan Turing may have called “morphogenesis” — the human, all too human, attempt to corral the world into anthropocentric metaphors that seek to convey the sublime, the edge of human understanding: the emergent patterns that occur when you recombine material with unexpectedly powerful new connections.</p>

<p>I’m honored to be the first DJ to start. But I’m also honored that many, many more will follow. The Archive is a mirror of infinite recombinant potential. I hope that its gift of free culture and free exchange creates a place where we will be comfortable with what is almost impossible to guess comes next. It is not a “collaborative filter” but a place where you are invited to explore on your own and come up with new ways of seeing the infinite memory palace of the fragments of history, time, and space that make this modern 21st century world work.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

Called “Phantom Dancehall,” it is an intense mix of hip hop, Jamaican ska and dancehall culture.</em></p>

On Friday, September 9th hip hop icons Dead Prez, actress Evangeline Lilly, punk legend Jello Biafra, Grammy winners La Santa Cecilia, and others will play a free concert at the Regency Ballroom in San Francisco to protest the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).</p>
<p>The TPP is a contentious trade agreement that is getting quite a bit of negative press in the 2016 U.S. election cycle. Among many other issues, the TPP would govern how signatory countries protect and enforce intellectual property rights. The TPP could have a large negative impact on libraries by increasing copyright term limits and neglecting the essential limitations on copyright law that libraries around the world rely on. Many different groups have vocally opposed the TPP, both for its substance and for the secrecy of the negotiations process.</p>

<p>The concert will be followed by a teach-in on “How to Fight the TPP” on Saturday, Sept. 10th from 1pm – 3pm at 1999 Bryant Street, hosted by experts from a wide range of organizations opposing the TPP.<br />
