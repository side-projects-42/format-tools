*The September 2021 DWeb Meetup explored the potential and reality of decentralized storage with two projects leading the way toward storing highly valuable cultural data at scale.*

*Watch the recording of the event and learn more about the speakers below.*

The September 2021 DWeb meetup was held virtually on Tuesday, September 28, 2021 at 10am PT, optimized for American/European time zones. Wendy Hanamura welcomed attendees and kicked off the meetup. Brewster Kahle, the founder of the Internet Archive, set the stage for the discussion by emphasising the need for a more secure and decentralized web. The Meetup also broached the possibility of a DWeb camp in the Fall of 2022.

The discussion explained the differences between the IPFS and Filecoin systems, how they work together and delved into the two projects led by Arkadiy Kukarkin and Jonathan Dotan which are at the cutting edge of storing large scale data of high cultural significance in the Filecoin network. They discussed the challenges, successes, and future opportunities presented by these efforts.

Lastly, attendees welcomed Eseohe “Ese” Ojo, the new DWeb Projects Organizer and said farewell to Mai Ishikawa Sutton as she goes off to grad school in Japan. Mai will continue to stay connected with the DWeb community and can be reached on Twitter [@maira](https://twitter.com/maira). Ese can be reached at <dweb@archive.org> or on Twitter [@EseoheOjo](http://twitter.com/eseoheojo). The meetup wrapped up with socializing and networking in Gather.town. 

The next DWeb Meetup **“DWeb Meetup Nov 2021 – Centering Respect, Trust and Equity in the DWeb”** is scheduled for Thursday, November 4, 2021 at 5pm PT, optimized for Asia time zones. At this meetup, we will hear the latest in the DWeb and from our featured speaker Coraline Ada Ehmke on centering respect, trust, and equity in the DWeb. You can read Coraline’s blog post on the DWeb principle of Mutual Respect [here](https://blog.archive.org/2021/09/03/the-sacred-geometry-of-respect-trust-and-equity/). 

We’re interested in hearing from DWeb projects about the breakthroughs, challenges, and new roadmaps they might be exploring. For anyone interested in participating in lightning rounds at this meetup, let us know [here](https://form.jotform.com/203236908715154).

[**Arkadiy Kukarkin**](https://twitter.com/parkan)**, DWeb engineer for the Internet Archive. Arkadiy** explained this nonprofit’s history with decentralization, from BitTorrent to today. He is leading a new project to explore how the Internet Archive could better decentralize its historical archives using Filecoin. He’s starting with End-of-Term data — all US government websites as they appear at the end and beginning of each Presidential Administration — starting with the 2016-2017 transition. At this talk, Arkadiy revealed his roadmap, lessons learned, and future direction.

**Jonathan Dotan, Founder of the** [**Starling Lab**](https://www.starlinglab.org/)**,** the first major research lab devoted to Web3 technologies. It is affiliated with Stanford and USC. Jonathan returned to the DWeb Meetup to bring us up-to-date on the [**USC Shoah Foundation Project**](https://sfi.usc.edu/), which preserves testimony of survivors of genocide on decentralized storage at huge scale. How does the process work and how do we keep these precious artifacts safe.

REVIEWS:

“*A call to arms to protect and preserve knowledge. A fine and moving book which ranges widely across time and acts as a reminder of the importance of libraries to our culture.*” — Wolfson History Prize judges  
  
“*Essential reading for anyone concerned with libraries and what Ovenden outlines as their role in ‘the support of democracy, the rule of law and open society.*”―Wall Street Journal  
  
“*\[Burning the Books\] takes a nightmare that haunts many of us―the notion of the past erased―and confirms that it is no fiction but rather a recurring reality. In the process, Ovenden stays true to his calling, reminding us that libraries and librarians are the keepers of humankind’s memories: without them, we don’t know who we are.*”―Jonathan Freedland, The Guardian  
  
“*Chronicles how libraries have served as sanctuaries for knowledge under constant threat, and what that means for the present and the future…Shows that when knowledge in print is threatened by power, it’s people pledged to the printed page, rather than armies, who step in…Made clear to me just how vulnerable libraries really are. When we don’t properly fund them, we risk lies becoming the truth, and the truth becoming a joke.*”―Slate

Following a recent [viral video](https://twitter.com/internetarchive/status/1358090982189719552) featuring our book digitization efforts, and increased demands for e-resources, we’ve had renewed interest in our book scanning partnerships, with libraries wondering how we might be able to help them reach their patrons through digitization. Join scanning center managers Andrea Mills and Elizabeth MacLeod for a virtual event to learn about the ways in which the Internet Archive can help turn your print collections digital, and the impacts that these digital collections are having on remote learners.

Registration for the virtual event is free and open to the public. The live session is being offered twice to accommodate schedules and flexibility; if you are interested in joining, you only need to register for one session:

[Public Domain Day Short Film Contest Highlights Works of 1925](https://blog.archive.org/2021/01/12/public-domain-day-short-film-contest-highlights-works-of-1925/)

Filmmakers responded with enthusiasm and creativity to a call from the Internet Archive to make short films using newly available content from 1925 in celebration of Public Domain Day. They discovered a new freedom in being able to remix film clips with Greta Garbo, magazine covers with flappers, and sheet music from standards like “Sweet Georgia Brown” – all downloadable for free and reusable without restriction.

For the contest, vintage images and sounds were woven into films of 2-3 minutes that conveyed a sense of whimsy, nostalgia, and humor. While some were abstract and others educational, they all showcased ingenuity and possibility when materials are openly available to the public.

 “The Internet Archive has spent  24 years collecting and archiving content from around the world…now is the time to see what people can do with it,” said Amir Saber Esfahani, director of special arts projects at the Internet Archive. He was a judge in the December short-film contest along with Carey Hott, professor of art and design at the University of San Francisco, and Brewster Kahle, digital librarian and founder of the Internet Archive.

The judges reviewed 23 entries and chose a winner based on creativity, variety of 1925 content (including lists of all sources), and fit for the event (fun, interesting and captivating). These new creative works may also be available for reuse, as indicated by the license term selected by the creator.

**First place**: ***Danse des Aliénés***
----------------------------------------

Joshua Curry, a digital artist from San Jose, won first place for his submission, *[Danse des Aliénés (Dance of the Insane)](https://archive.org/details/danse-de-alienes/danse-de-alienes.mp4)*, in which he layers pieces of film on three panes with images rising and falling music to “Dance Macabre” (Dance of Death) performed by the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra. The format was inspired by the poem dramatized in triptych in the short film *[In Youth, Beside the Lonely Sea](https://archive.org/details/silent-in-youth-beside-the-lonely-sea)*.  His creation included flashes of Greta Garbo, ghosts from *[Koko Sees Spooks](https://archive.org/details/silent-koko-sees-spooks)* and colorful designs flowing in and out of the frames.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danse.png" alt="Watch Danse des Aliénés." class="wp-image-22240" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danse.png 650w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danse-300x170.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danse-624x354.png 624w" width="537" height="305" /><figcaption>Watch <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/danse-de-alienes/danse-de-alienes.mp4">Danse des Aliénés</a></em>.</figcaption></figure>

Curry, who has been [making experimental videos](https://lucidbeaming.com/glitch/) since the 1980s, says the project was a perfect fit for his artist techniques, where he likes to stress and transform film in new ways. His film had a glitchy, broken feel that is in line with the aesthetic he often uses (See his other work at lucidbeaming.com.)

“I wanted it to be evocative and for people to appreciate it as a stand-alone piece of art,” says Curry, 49. “My visual goal was to produce something challenging that a wide variety of people could connect to – despite being mostly abstract and sourced from 95-year-old content.”

While Curry’s studio is modern and full of electronic equipment, working with the 1925 content and hearing music with cartoonish voices making novelty, popping sounds their cheeks was a welcome break. “One day when I was choosing the music, I was driving around the city listening to songs and felt like I was transported back in time,” Curry says.

He says it was also a pleasure to have easy access to the public domain content without commercial gatekeeping or legal obstacles, which he often encounters with digital material he wants to remix. As it happens, Curry just completed a class in multimedia copyright. He says he works hard to operate within the rules because he wants his video creations to survive online and not be taken down because of copyright infringement allegations.

Having the works for this project in the public domain meant less time trying to get the content and more time to focus on the creative process. “It was like being a little kid who was told he couldn’t have cake and then one day saying: ‘Dive in!’,” Curry said of the access to the 1925 material in the Internet Archive.

Receiving the contest’s top honors was particularly meaningful, says Curry, because he works in Silicon Valley where the Internet Archive has “great nerd cred” and is a library that people revere.

“I was proud to win with weirdness,” Curry says. “My piece was abstract, without narration or titles, and an authentic tribute to the pioneering work of the experimental films I made use of.”

**Second place: *Vanishing Ink***
---------------------------------

Second place went to Alaro Brandon for *[Vanishing Ink](https://archive.org/details/vanishing-ink-ff)*, a film with a montage of clips from 16 movies including *[The Last Laugh](https://archive.org/details/silent-the-last-laugh)* and *[Hold My Baby](https://archive.org/details/HoldMyBaby1925)* and four songs: “[Norwegian Dances](https://archive.org/details/78_norwegian-dances-op-35-no-1-allegro-marcata-in-d-minor_london-symphony-orchestr),” “[Song of the Vagabonds](https://archive.org/details/78_song-of-the-vagabonds_leo-reisman-and-his-orchestra-friml-and-hooker_gbia0243903a/Song+of+the+Vagabonds+-+LEO+REISMAN+AND+HIS+ORCHESTRA.flac),” “[I Want to be Happy](https://archive.org/details/78_i-want-to-be-happy_the-hannan-dance-band-caeser-youmans_gbia0216518b)” and “[Hawaiian Ripples](https://archive.org/details/78_hawaiian-ripples---hondas-hawaiienas_castlewood-marimba-band-olcott-preston_gbia0001922b).”

**Third place: *Fashion of the 1920s***
---------------------------------------

Arden Spivack-Teather, 12, and Sissel Ramierz, 13, both of San Francisco, won third place for their short film, *[Fashion of the 1920s](https://archive.org/details/img-3485_202012).* It traces the evolution of women’s clothing from tight-fitting styles that required corsets to drop-waisted, loose dresses popularized by flappers. “Women could finally be chic and comfortable at the same time,” the film notes. “Every time you notice a fabulous flowing frock, thank the 20s.”

On Zoom and FaceTime, the girls looked through old McCalls magazines and decided to focus on the changing style of women’s clothing.

“It was really fun to use our creativity and find things that would look good together,” said Arden, who had never before made a film. Although the research, script and editing were a challenge, she says she hopes to do it again.

Spivack said she enjoyed seeing her daughter explore the material in the Archive, giggling and musing at the kitchen table about the tonics and ads she discovered. “It was exactly what I was hoping would happen — that they would be gripped by fascination of a time period that was long gone. They could travel back and learn on their own, paging through a magazine just like someone their age would have in 1925.”

The diversity of approaches people had with the films was impressive, added Spivack.

“It’s a good introduction to what can be done with old materials. You can use them to learn and to educate others. Or you can reuse them to make something that’s completely unexpected or never seen before,” Spivack said. “As archivists everything is important. But you don’t know why until you see what it can turn into or what it informs in the future.”

They were all first released in 1925. And looking ahead, that means that when the sun rises on 2021, thousands of works of literature, film, music and art will enter the public domain. We think having free access to these cultural riches is something to celebrate!

The public domain is our shared cultural heritage, a near limitless trove of creativity that’s been reused, remixed, and reimagined over centuries to create new works of art and science. The public domain forms the building blocks of culture because these works are not restricted by copyright law. Generally, works come into the public domain when their copyright term expires. This year, [works first published in 1925](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_in_public_domain) are entering the public domain for all to share.

This year’s virtual Forum ended last week with an inspiring session showcasing the impact of [controlled digital lending](https://controlleddigitallending.org/). Let’s look back over some of the key moments from the session and the conference as a whole. 

During the final session, we were honored to [present Michelle Wu with our Hero Award](https://blog.archive.org/2020/10/20/michelle-wu-receives-internet-archive-hero-award-for-establishing-the-legal-basis-for-controlled-digital-lending/) for her foundational work on controlled digital lending. COVID-19 demonstrated more than ever the power of this key practice in helping libraries reach vulnerable communities. As the election approaches, the emphasis was also on the role of digital access in supporting democracy. “Reliable access to information is the great equalizer,” Wu said in her acceptance speech. 

The power of digital tools was demonstrated further during the session with [the grand reopening of Marygrove College Library](http://blog.archive.org/2020/10/20/digitization-saves-marygrove-college-library-after-closure/). Despite the closure of the college, the library’s valuable collection of social justice scholarship has started a new life online. The materials are now [freely available on our website](https://archive.org/details/marygrovecollege), showcasing the power of digitization for preserving knowledge and expanding access. If you missed the session, you can [watch the recording](https://archive.org/details/library-leaders-forum-impact) or [read a full recap](http://blog.archive.org/2020/10/22/library-leaders-forum-explores-impact-of-controlled-digital-lending/). 

The conference was packed with insight into the impact of controlled digital lending on libraries and the communities they serve. In our [policy session](http://blog.archive.org/2020/10/08/library-leaders-forum-kicks-off-with-policy-discussion-ways-to-better-serve-the-public/), experts discussed how to build a healthy information ecosystem for the 21st Century. Our [community session](https://blog.archive.org/2020/10/15/library-leaders-forum-highlights-community-of-practice-supporting-controlled-digital-lending/) gave a platform to librarians, educators, and technologists who are developing next-generation library tools. 

The discussions showed a library community deeply committed to digital innovation and its potential for creating a more equal society. A key theme was how COVID-19 lockdowns have made librarians more aware of the necessity of digital lending. The practice, always useful in reaching communities who cannot access physical books, has been shown a powerful tool in emergency response. Practitioners also placed emphasis on the key role of digitization in archiving knowledge for future generations. 

However, it was clear that this is no time for complacency. Librarians face threats that would damage their ability to make knowledge accessible and preserve it for cultural posterity. [A new lawsuit](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/publishers-are-taking-the-internet-to-court/) challenges their right to digitize collections and make them available to the public. Combined with an increasing lack of shelf space and spates of library closures, this could mean that many valuable collections end up in landfill.

To this end, we have launched the [\#EmpoweringLibraries campaign](http://blog.archive.org/empoweringlibraries/), which defends the right of libraries to own and lend digital books. Although the Forum has ended, the community will stay united through campaign activities. 

We’d like to say a huge thank you to everyone who took part and helped make the Library Leaders Forum a great success. Find out how you can stay connected and protect the key role of libraries in a democratic society [here](http://blog.archive.org/empoweringlibraries/).
