[Access to Rare Historical Materials Makes an Ocean of Difference for Stanford Professor](https://blog.archive.org/2021/09/01/access-to-rare-historical-materials-makes-an-ocean-of-difference-for-stanford-professor/)
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Posted on [September 1, 2021](https://blog.archive.org/2021/09/01/access-to-rare-historical-materials-makes-an-ocean-of-difference-for-stanford-professor/ "12:00 pm")<span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/caraleeadams/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by Caralee Adams">Caralee Adams</a></span></span>

The kind of materials that Stanford English professor Margaret Cohen uses in her work, including the history of ocean travel in the period known as the “Age of Sail,” can be difficult to find.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/margaret-cohen-square1510797692858.jpeg" alt="Professor Margaret Cohen, Andrew B.

Hammond Professor of French Language, Literature, and Civilization and Director, Center for the Study of the Novel at Stanford University.</figcaption></figure>

Books and illustrations from the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries needed in her research and teaching are often tucked away in rare book collections. For about five years, Cohen has been turning to the Internet Archive for help. And that access was even more critical during the pandemic when physical libraries were closed.

“It’s really enriched the arguments I can make about cultural history,” Cohen said. “The availability of documents and the very intensive work of tracking these down has become so much easier. The Internet Archive is a very user-friendly tool.”

The [Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://archive.org/details/biodiversity) has been a resource to Cohen in teaching her English class, Imagining the Ocean. She has discovered [manuals from Philip Henry Gosse](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Philip+Henry+Gosse%22), who created the first public aquarium, envisioning them as beautiful ocean gardens.  Cohen also shares her screen with students to discuss drawings of the sails, seashore and [sea-anemones](https://archive.org/details/actinologiabrita00goss/page/n9/mode/2up) from the Victorian Age that she accesses through the Archive.

“Access to the history of science is useful to me. I’m a literature professor, but the imagination spans across different areas,” said Cohen, the Andrew B. Hammond Professor of French Language, Literature, and Civilization and Director, Center for the Study of the Novel.

In her own research of oceanic studies, Cohen explores the importance of diversity and reality in marine environments. She tapped into the Internet Archive to fact-check information for *[A Cultural History of the Sea](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/cultural-history-of-the-sea-9781474299107)*, (Bloomsbury, April 2021), a six-volume series that she edited chronicling the vital role oceans have played over time.

In researching her upcoming book, *The Underwater Eye: How the Movie Camera Opened the Depths and Unleashed New Realms of Fantasy* to be published by Princeton University Press, Cohen said the Wayback Machine was critical in confirming sources on websites that were no longer live.

The [Sci-Fi/Horror collection](https://archive.org/details/SciFi_Horror) of the Internet Archive has been useful to Cohen in teaching a course on Gothic film—especially since YouTube recently took down many of its films in that genre, she said.

Much of the material Cohen is looking for is in the public domain (such as [*Punch*](https://archive.org/details/pub_punch), a satirical British magazine that dates back to the mid-1800s ) but the documents are fragile because of their age. She has also  appreciated being able to borrow classic books of literary criticism, such as the collection on novel studies that supports her graduate course, Genres of the Novel. 

 “People’s time is limited and having access to this material facilitates scholarship,” Cohen said of the benefits of digitized documents. “I understand why publishers need to make money and I publish myself, but free access to information, particularly for nonprofit use, is a gift.”

[Graduate Student: Internet Archive an “absolutely indispensable resource”](https://blog.archive.org/2021/08/25/graduate-student-internet-archive-an-absolutely-indispensable-resource/)
========================================================================================================================================================================================

Posted on [August 25, 2021](https://blog.archive.org/2021/08/25/graduate-student-internet-archive-an-absolutely-indispensable-resource/ "12:00 pm")<span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/caraleeadams/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by Caralee Adams">Caralee Adams</a></span></span>

Although Casey Patterson spent much of the COVID-19 lockdown in a dank San Francisco basement apartment, he says he felt lucky in many ways.

The graduate student in English from Stanford University stayed healthy and—despite not having physical access to a library—was able to research his dissertation, teach classes, and prepare for job interviews. This was possible because of online access to materials through the Internet Archive.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Imagen-de-iOS.jpg" alt="Graduate student and educator, Casey Patterson" class="wp-image-23351" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Imagen-de-iOS.jpg 1000w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Imagen-de-iOS-300x300.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Imagen-de-iOS-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Imagen-de-iOS-768x768.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Imagen-de-iOS-624x624.jpg 624w" width="360" height="360" /><figcaption>Graduate student and educator, Casey Patterson</figcaption></figure>

Patterson, who is entering the sixth year of his doctoral program, offered to teach an online African American literature class to undergraduates as soon as COVID-19 shut down the campus and the university shifted to virtual instruction.

“I just felt a degree of duty to sign up for a lot of teaching. I wanted to be able to support students and knew the transition to online education was going to be rocky,” said Patterson, who also taught an Intro to Black Studies course during the pandemic. “It was chaotic. Obviously, we had a really tough time trying to figure out how to keep students engaged and make education a humane process.”

Instead of expecting students to buy several books, and without the ability for them to check out books in a library, Patterson turned to the Internet Archive. Patterson found works of Black critics such as Toni Morrison and C.L.R. James and their writings about 19<sup>th</sup> century authors Edgar Allen Poe and Herman Melville to use in class. He downloaded classics including [Moby Dick](https://archive.org/details/mobydick00melv_1) and [Huckleberry Finn](https://archive.org/details/adventuresofhuck00twai) to the Canvas learning management system and made them immediately available to students.

“It’s super helpful when you’re asking students to read 10 short passages from three different novels,” Patterson said of using the Internet Archive. “It would be cruel to ask them to buy all of the books or track them down to the library. This way you put them right at the students’ fingertips.”

Patterson also relied on text from the Internet Archive for his own research. For his dissertation, he is examining the role of educational history as a way of understanding African American literary studies and the institutionalization of Black studies as a discipline.

This spring, he interviewed for an academic job in which he was asked to prepare a lesson plan syllabus for a teaching demonstration. Having access to [The Book of American Negro Poetry](https://archive.org/details/bookofamericanne01john), works of African-American poet [Phillis Wheatley](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Wheatley%2C+Phillis%2C+1753-1784%22), and [essays by Alice Walker](https://archive.org/details/insearchofourmot0000walk) enabled Patterson to put together materials from the convenience of his apartment on a tight deadline.

In the summer of 2019, Patterson had used the Internet Archive in his Fandom research, another area of interest. He’d run across a citation to a website that was no longer available online and was able to track it down through the Wayback Machine. But since the pandemic, Patterson says he’s come to value the Internet Archive for its collection of primary sources.

“Knowledge is for everybody. The more we can do to break down the barriers that make it inaccessible, the better off everyone is,” said Patterson. “The Internet Archive is one great example of how we can do that almost with a click of a button.”

[Reading Online Books a “Highlight” for Students During Pandemic](https://blog.archive.org/2021/08/18/reading-online-books-a-highlight-for-students-during-pandemic/)
=====================================================================================================================================================================

Motivating students to stay engaged with online instruction can take some creativity.

Working at a special education learning center in Los Angeles, Luca Messarra found the promise of choosing a book to read for fun after a lesson kept his 9- to 11-year-old kids going. Although access to physical books was limited during the pandemic, he found digital versions in the Internet Archive that made all the difference.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Luca-1024x911.jpg" alt="Educator and graduate student Luca Messarra." class="wp-image-23334" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Luca-1024x911.jpg 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Luca-300x267.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Luca-768x683.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Luca-624x555.jpg 624w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Luca.jpg 1122w" width="312" height="277" /><figcaption>Educator and graduate student Luca Messarra.</figcaption></figure>

Messarra’s individual work with students moved online in March 2020, in the early days of the pandemic. He continued to help them learn to read and write by doing drills remotely, using online instruction materials provided by the learning center. It did not have access to digital works of fiction, but Messarra says those were the books that most excited the students.

“That was the most fun because it was an opportunity for them to see the fruits of their labor. They could read a book, finally,” says the 25-year-old who lives in Palo Alto. “It’s far more entertaining to read a book than to do drills over and over again. That was the highlight for a lot of students—to finally be able to read a book of their own choosing.”

Since wrapping up his job at the learning center, Messarra has been enrolled in a graduate English program at Stanford University where he is specializing in digital humanities and postcolonialism.

Looking back on his teaching experience during the pandemic, Messarra says he values the resources from the Internet Archive. “It was incredibly helpful and quite essential to boost the morale of students. They were bored and frustrated because of the pandemic,” he says. “For one of my students, it was his goal to read Harry Potter. Once he was able to read it, he was super excited and eventually bought the book because he was having such a good time.”

“If the \[Great 78 Project\] didn’t exist, I don’t think I would have this curriculum at all,” said Luther, assistant professor for Writing Arts in the Ric Edelman College of Communication & Creative Arts at Rowan. “What I really like is the research challenge. It’s really powerful. So many times students have recovered the lost histories of these songs.”

For [The Phono Project](https://www.phonoproject.com/), Rowan students create podcasts and social media posts about recordings in the Archive’s 78s collection. They also tap into [primary sources on the Archive](https://archive.org/details/internationalbibliographyofdiscographies) to write the history of the songs. They can write about the stories behind songs like the Billie Holiday classic “[God Bless the Child](https://www.phonoproject.com/2020/02/27/god-bless-the-child-by-billie-holiday/),” or John Lee Hooker’s “[Boogie Chillen](https://www.phonoproject.com/2021/03/02/boogie-chillen-by-john-lee-hooker/)” from 1948. Many gravitate to artists like [Elvis Presley](https://www.phonoproject.com/?s=elvis) or [Frank Sinatra](https://www.phonoproject.com/?s=sinatra), but Luther tries to get them to branch out—especially now that there are more than 200 stories in the project’s [collection](https://www.phonoproject.com/).

Luther developed the project in 2018 as part of the “Technologies and Future of Writing” module in the writing course. Students have just eight classes to complete the 1-3 minute podcasts, in which they learn to master a mix of audio tools and editing skills using Audacity and WordPress. The course covers issues of compatibility and ownership, along with instruction on the economy of writing like a critic about lyrics and culture. For one recent class session, he invited Liz Rosenberg of the Archive to be a guest speaker and talk about the organization’s work and the [Great 78 Project](http://great78.archive.org/).

In the future, Luther said he would like to find more ways to incorporate some of the Archive’s collection into his curriculum. For instance, he may have students use primary source documents from independent publishers over time to craft something tangible, such as an actual history from those materials that could be passed along. “That’s one of the neat things about accretion,” he said. “We have the creativity, but then there’s also documents on the Archive that are helping us understand the 78s themselves. It’s such a vast resource.”

[Internet Archive’s Modern Book Collection Now Tops 2 Million Volumes](https://blog.archive.org/2021/02/03/internet-archives-modern-book-collection-now-tops-2-million-volumes/)

That’s how many modern books are now in its [lending collection](https://archive.org/details/inlibrary)—available free to the public to borrow at any time, even from home.

“We are going strong,” said Chris Freeland, a librarian at the Internet Archive and director of the Open Libraries program. “We are making books available that people need access to online, and our patrons are really invested. We are doing a library’s work in the digital era.”

The lending collection is an encyclopedic mix of purchased books, ebooks, and [donations](https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360017876312-How-do-I-make-a-physical-donation-to-the-Internet-Archive-) from individuals, organizations, and institutions. It has been curated by Freeland and other librarians at the Internet Archive according to a [prioritized wish list](http://blog.archive.org/2018/09/10/revised-wish-list-now-available-1-5m-books-we-want/) that has guided collection development. The collection has been purpose-built to reach a wide base of both public and academic library patrons, and to contain books that people want to read and access online—titles that are widely held by libraries, cited in Wikipedia and frequently assigned on syllabi and course reading lists.

“The Internet Archive is trying to achieve a collection reflective of great research and public libraries like the Boston Public Library,” said Brewster Kahle, digital librarian and founder of the Internet Archive, who began building the diverse library more than 20 years ago.

“Libraries from around the world have been contributing books so that we can make sure the digital generation has access to the best knowledge ever written,” Kahle said. “These wide ranging collections include books curated by educators, librarians and individuals, that they see are critical to educating an informed populace at a time of massive disinformation and misinformation.”

The 2 million modern books are part of the Archive’s larger collection of [28 million texts](https://archive.org/details/texts) that include older books in the public domain, magazines, and documents. Beyond texts, millions of [movies](https://archive.org/details/movies), [television news programs](https://archive.org/details/tv), [images](https://archive.org/details/image), [live music concerts](https://archive.org/details/etree), and [other sound recordings](https://archive.org/details/audio?tab=collection) are also available, as well as more than [500 billion web pages](http://web.archive.org/) that have been archived by the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/). Nearly 1.5 million unique patrons use the Internet Archive each day, and about 17,000 items are uploaded daily.

**Presenting the (representative) 2 millionth book**
----------------------------------------------------

Every day about 3,500 books are digitized in one of 18 digitization centers operated by the Archive worldwide. While there’s no exact way of identifying a singular 2 millionth book, the Internet Archive has chosen a representative title that helped push past the benchmark to highlight why its collection is so useful to readers and researchers online.

On December 31, [*The dictionary of costume*](https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofcost0000wilc/mode/2up) by R. Turner Wilcox was scanned and added to the Archive, putting the collection over the 2 million mark. The book was first published in 1969 and reprinted throughout the 1990s, but is now no longer in print or widely held by libraries. This particular book was donated to Better World Books via a book bank just outside of London in August 2020, then made its way to the Internet Archive for preservation and digitization.

Turner Wilcox, now available for borrowing at <a href="https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofcost0000wilc/">archive.org</a>.</figcaption></figure>As expected from the title, the book is a dictionary of terms associated with costumes, textiles and fashion, and was compiled by an expert, Wilcox, the fashion editor of *Women’s Wear Daily* from 1910 to 1915. Given its authoritative content, the book made it onto the Archive’s wish list because it is frequently cited in Wikipedia, including on pages like [Petticoat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petticoat) and [Gown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gown). 

Now that the book has been digitized, Wikipedia editors can update citations to the book and include a direct link to the cited page. For example, users reading the [Petticoat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petticoat#cite_ref-:1_3-0) page can see that [page 267](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petticoat#cite_ref-:1_3-0) of the book has been used to substantiate the claim that both men & women wore a longer underskirt called a “petticote” in the fourteenth century. Clicking on that reference will take users [directly to page 267 in *The dictionary of costume*](https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofcost0000wilc/page/267) where they can read the dictionary entry for petticoat and verify that information for themselves.

This book is one of the millions of titles that reached the end of its publishing lifecycle in the 20th century, so there is no electronic version available for purchase. That means that the only way of accessing this book online and verifying these citations in Wikipedia—doing the kind of research that students of all ages perform in our connected world—is through a scanned copy, such as the one [now available](https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofcost0000wilc/mode/2up) at the Internet Archive. 

**Donations play an important role**
------------------------------------

Increasingly, the Archive is preserving many books that would otherwise be lost to history or the trash bin.

In recent years, the Internet Archive has received donations of entire library collections. Marygrove College gave more than 70,000 books and nearly 3,000 journal volumes for digitization and preservation in 2019 after the small liberal arts college in Detroit closed. The well-curated collection, known for its social justice, education and humanities holdings, is now available online at <https://archive.org/details/marygrovecollege>.

Several seminaries have donated substantial or complete collections to the Archive to preserve items or to give them a new life as their libraries were being moved or downsized. Digital access is now available for items from the [Claremont School of Theology](http://blog.archive.org/2020/06/30/premier-religious-school-donates-quarter-of-a-million-volumes-to-internet-archives-open-library/), [Hope International University](http://blog.archive.org/2020/09/09/hope-international-universitys-journals-get-new-digital-life/), [Evangelical Seminary](http://blog.archive.org/?s=evangelical+seminary), [Princeton Theological Seminary](https://www.ptsem.edu/), and [Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary](https://archive.org/details/anabaptistmennonitedigitallibrary). 

Just like *The dictionary of costume*, many of the books supplied for digitization come to the Archive from [Better World Books](https://www.betterworldbooks.com/). In its partnership over the past 10 years, the online book seller has donated millions of books to be digitized and preserved by the Archive. [Better World Books](https://www.betterworldbooks.com/) acquires books from thousands of libraries, book suppliers, and through a network of book donation drop boxes (known as “book banks” in the UK), and if a title is not suitable for resale and it’s on the Archive’s wish list, the book is set aside for donation.  

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BWBlogo-2.png" class="wp-image-22416" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BWBlogo-2.png 500w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BWBlogo-2-300x85.png 300w" width="363" height="102" /></figure>

“We view our role as helping maximize the life cycle and value of each and every single book that a library client, book supplier or donor entrusts to us,” said Dustin Holland, president and chief executive officer of [Better World Books](https://www.betterworldbooks.com/). “We make every effort to make books available to readers and keep books in the reading cycle and out of the recycle stream. Our partnership with the Internet Archive makes all this possible.”

The Archive provides another channel for customers to find materials, Holland added.

“We view [archive.org](https://archive.org/) as a way of discovering and accessing books,” said Holland. “Once a book is discoverable, the more interest you are going to create in that book and the greater the chance it will end up in a reader’s hands as a new or gently used book.”

**Impact**
----------

Having books freely available for borrowing online serves people with a variety of needs including those with limited access to libraries because of disabilities, transportation issues, people in rural areas, and those who live in under-resourced parts of the world.

Sean, an author in Oregon said he goes through older magazines for design ideas, especially from cultures that he wouldn’t be exposed to otherwise: “It gives me a wider understanding of my small place in the global historical context.” One parent from San Francisco said she uses the lending library to learn skills like hand drawing to draw characters and landscapes to interact deeper with her child.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jessica-1024x683.png" class="wp-image-22423" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jessica-1024x683.png 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jessica-300x200.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jessica-768x512.png 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jessica-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jessica-2048x1365.png 2048w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jessica-624x416.png 624w" width="1024" height="683" /></figure>The need for information is more urgent than ever.

“We are all homeschoolers now. This pandemic has driven home how important it is to have online access to quality information,” Kahle said. “It’s gratifying to hear from teachers and parents that are now given the tools to work with their children during this difficult time.”

Kahle’s vision is to have every reference in Wikipedia be linked to a book and for every student writing a high school report to have access to the best published research on their subject. He wants the next generation to become authors of the books that should be in the library and the most informed electorate possible.

Adds Kahle: “Thank you to all who have made this possible – all the funders, all the donors, the thousands who have sent books to be digitized. If we all work together, we can do another million this year.”

*Authorized readers have special access to millions of digitized books through the Internet Archive’s program, connecting patrons with print disabilities to a vast digital library.*

Doug Wilson says he’s a bit of a “bookaholic.” As senior pastor of a nondenominational church in West Covina, California, he surrounds himself with books at his office and study at home.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BLAN42-CER-12.jpg" alt="Pastor Doug Wilson is an avid reader who benefits from Internet Archive’s program for people with print disabilities." class="wp-image-22292" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BLAN42-CER-12.jpg 958w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BLAN42-CER-12-300x199.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BLAN42-CER-12-768x510.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BLAN42-CER-12-624x414.jpg 624w" width="958" height="636" /><figcaption>Pastor Doug Wilson is an avid reader who benefits from Internet Archive’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/printdisabled&amp;tab=about">program for people with print disabilities</a>.</figcaption></figure>“I’m a voracious reader and love learning,” said Wilson, who recalls taking a wagon to the library every week as a kid and bringing back a stack of books. “I find life intriguing.”

The 64-year-old said his vision has never been great, but within the last year noticed it was worsening. Wilson was struggling to read print with small font sizes or in low light.  An avid user of the Internet Archive, he learned about the Archive’s [program for users with print disabilities](https://archive.org/details/printdisabled&tab=about), which allows authorized users to skip waitlists for the ebook collection and download protected EPUBs and PDFs. Wilson applied for the program and was granted access, with great results.

“It’s so helpful to be able to have multiple resources open at once on my computer,” said Wilson, who looks up material online from ancient thought to contemporary theology for his sermons. “It’s been wonderful to find something on just about anything.”  

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/jessamyn-edited.jpeg" alt="Jessamyn West of the Vermont Mutual Aid Society, who helps qualified users with print disabilities gain access to Internet Archive’s lending library." class="wp-image-22291" width="366" height="262" /><figcaption>Jessamyn West of the Vermont Mutual Aid Society, who <a href="https://archive.org/details/printdisabled&amp;tab=about">helps qualified users with print disabilities</a> gain access to Internet Archive’s lending library.</figcaption></figure>

[Signing up](https://archive.org/details/printdisabled&tab=about) for the program was easy and fast, said Wilson. Students and researchers associated with a university can obtain access through their university library or student success center. For those outside higher ed, the process is run by Jessamyn West at the [Vermont Mutual Aid Society](http://www.librarian.net/vtmas/), who receives requests through an online form from patrons around the world. People who [qualify for the program](https://archive.org/details/printdisabled&tab=about) include those with blindness, low-vision, dyslexia, brain injuries and other cognition problems who need extra time to interact with materials. Since October 2018, West has welcomed more than 5,600 users into the program.

“It makes a real difference to people’s lives,” said West. “Especially nowadays when many people are stuck at home and working with limited resources, having a world of accessible books available to them opens doors and expands horizons. I’ve seen people checking out books on drawing and painting, books about art history and comparative religions, and just a lot of fiction. The collection is truly extensive.”

With expanded access to digitized books, Wilson said he has been reconnecting with works written by many of his mentors through the [digital theological collections](http://blog.archive.org/2020/12/02/internet-archive-broadens-global-access-to-theological-material/). “It’s been a profound gift to discover those books that have been influential in my life. Getting access has been another way to be encouraged and mentored even from a distance,” said Wilson, adding he is in a season of life when many of those people are passing away. “The service has been so generous and a supplement to my own library.”

Being able to find the exact resource he needs from home and late at night is a convenience that Wilson said he values. Wilson has enjoyed books from [Marygrove Library](https://archive.org/details/marygrovecollege), a collection full of religious and social justice materials that was recently donated and made available online.

In an era with competing forms of information and disinformation, Wilson said the Internet Archive is important. “Wisdom is hard to come by,” said Wilson. “We are barraged with data in our culture.

[Author Shares Mentoring Expertise Through Controlled Digital Lending](https://blog.archive.org/2020/09/17/author-shares-mentoring-expertise-through-controlled-digital-lending/)
=================================================================================================================================================================================

Posted on [September 17, 2020](https://blog.archive.org/2020/09/17/author-shares-mentoring-expertise-through-controlled-digital-lending/ "6:00 pm")<span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/caraleeadams/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by Caralee Adams">Caralee Adams</a></span></span>

Rik Nemanick believes in the power of mentoring in the workplace. As an author, corporate consultant, and university instructor, he explains to business leaders and students how a mentor can bring the best out in others.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mentorswayeightr0000nema_0001t.jpg" alt="The Mentor’s Way: Eight Rules for Bringing Out the Best in Others by Rik Nemanick, now available for borrowing through Controlled Digital Lending." class="wp-image-21416" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mentorswayeightr0000nema_0001t.jpg 510w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mentorswayeightr0000nema_0001t-191x300.jpg 191w" width="303" height="475" /><figcaption><a href="https://archive.org/details/mentorswayeightr0000nema">The Mentor’s Way: Eight Rules for Bringing Out the Best in Others</a> by Rik Nemanick, now available for borrowing through Controlled Digital Lending.</figcaption></figure>

“A mentor is different from a teacher who imparts knowledge,” Nemanick says. “A good mentor broadens someone’s perspective and opens doors. It’s about challenging someone’s thinking and creating a relationship.”

Over the years, the St. Louis businessman was urged to put his leadership development research and expertise into a book. Published in 2016 by Routledge, [*The Mentor’s Way: Eight Rules for Bringing Out the Best in Others*](https://archive.org/details/mentorswayeightr0000nema), is now available for lending through the Internet Archive.

“I want my message out there. I saw the Internet Archive as a way to make it more available to more people,” Nemanick says of his recent donation to the Controlled Digital Lending program. “The book sitting on Amazon or a shelf doesn’t get anyone engaged as much as if it’s available at the library.”

One of the first things that Nemanick says he did when the book was published was to donate a copy to Washington University Library in St. Louis. He wanted it available for students in his executive education graduate courses in leadership, mentoring, and human resource metrics so they could learn the concepts he advocates.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nemanick.jpeg" alt="Author and mentoring consultant Rik Nemanick" class="wp-image-21417" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nemanick.jpeg 288w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nemanick-200x300.jpeg 200w" width="288" height="433" /><figcaption>Author and mentoring consultant Rik Nemanick</figcaption></figure>

Through his work, Nemanick says he wants to challenge the way people think about mentoring and offer practical ideas. Often people enter their careers with certain, narrow expectations and a mentor can be critical with the workplace adjustment. “A mentor can help someone find their way in their profession,” he says. “My hope is that people can find their fit more easily with the information in my book.”

Nemanick says he does not worry about his book being hurt by library lending through Controlled Digital Lending.

“This is a respectful way to get your message heard. A fair number of authors just want people to read what they have written,” he says. “It’s just one more avenue to make sure it gets into people’s hands.”

*By Matt Poland, educational specialist*

There’s little doubt that both learning and work require a high degree of technology use. As schooling continues to move online in response to COVID-19, students are expected to be able to access, process, manipulate, and interpret digital content. This has brought to light a significant skill that separates successful learners from those who struggle: digital fluency. Digital fluency is a [step above](https://edtechfactotum.com/digital-fluency-vs-digital-literacy/) “digital literacy.” Learners now need to know much more than just the basics of navigating the internet, writing an email, and making their way around common productivity applications like spreadsheets. Digital fluency includes skills such as using technology tools for collaboration, marshaling online resources to solve a problem, and evaluating the accuracy of a source.

Despite the “whiz-kid” reputation of Generation Z, an alarming number of high school students lack the appropriate level of digital fluency. This set of skills is part of a larger group of key work and learning aptitudes called [21st Century Skills](https://newworldofwork.org/). A lack of digital fluency can harm students’ futures as they progress into college and careers where these skills are necessary.

> Students and teachers can use Internet Archive as a collaborative tool for sharing books and digital content across remote teams or classrooms, removing the physical barriers of access to books and collaborators.

Fortunately, having students complete assignments with the aid of the [Internet Archive’s digital library](https://archive.org/details/books) can help build digital fluency. Students and teachers can use Internet Archive as a collaborative tool for sharing books and digital content across remote teams or classrooms, removing the physical barriers of access to books and collaborators. They can use digital libraries like Internet Archive to conduct research for assignments, with access to 20th-century texts that aren’t available from other sources. Finally, they can cross-reference sources to evaluate the accuracy of material they may find elsewhere on the internet.

Other features of Internet Archive’s digital library promote digital fluency for students as well. For example, the site includes advanced search and sorting features that are commonly used on research websites. It is critical for students to understand how to use the right keywords to find what they need, as well as how to find the most recent (or oldest) material, particular authors or publications, etc. On Internet Archive, this can be done from the advanced search options in the left toolbar. Sorting by the number of views, title, date published or the creator is available by clicking the appropriate header at the top of the search results. Even when you have the material you are looking for, you need to know how to find the specific content within it. You can do this at Internet Archive by using the search box in the upper right corner when a particular book is open on the screen.

Nearly a quarter of the way into the 21st century, learning is changing rapidly and digital fluency is becoming increasingly important for students. Tools such as [Internet Archive’s digital library](https://archive.org/details/books) can help students develop these skills through activities like team collaboration, online research, and verifying sources. With multiple features that support learning in the classroom or remotely, teachers and students should consider Internet Archive a valuable resource for their work and learning.

[Open Library: A Tool for Student Equity during our Digital Fall Semester](https://blog.archive.org/2020/07/09/open-library-a-tool-for-student-equity-during-our-digital-fall-semester/)

*By Michelle Swanson, an educator and national educational specialist from Eugene, OR*

While education leaders and classroom teachers have discussed the growing issue of the [Digital Divide](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/26/nearly-one-in-five-teens-cant-always-finish-their-homework-because-of-the-digital-divide/) for years, its severity has become painfully clear as classrooms have been forced online during school closures. [The results](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/27/862705225/survey-shows-big-remote-learning-gaps-for-low-income-and-special-needs-children?utm_source=EdSurgeInstruct&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=5-28-2020&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTlRjME56YzJabU5oTkRRMyIsInQiOiI3UUJDOVl1ZGNSTWRmNkNReDh6bnBvdStvUHpMYm5jNWQ2cEhLNlFvdEttRWFWQjAzbEk3QXJYNnd1bGpcL255T2tsaURQWkxSZ2REZ2p4MDREdFAwdjdBVFg0em9GeVpiUUdvaEVKOVg2V2JrWE1yV0hiTmVHdzcrUUprMHNvRFcifQ%3D%3D) of distance learning show low levels of engagement and progress for students from homes lacking internet access and devices. In addition, students facing the digital gap tend to have fewer books at home and live in communities struggling to keep libraries open. The pandemic has brought these serious equity issues to the forefront.

Closing the technology divide by ensuring that every student has a personal learning device and reliable internet access at home is a critical first step. Districts looking for guidance on 1:1 initiatives should look to ISTE’s definition of [equitable technology](https://www.iste.org/standards/essential-conditions/equitable-access) access that makes up one of their “[essential conditions](https://www.iste.org/standards/essential-conditions)” for supporting all learners.

Once students have a computer and WiFi, school leaders can look to the Internet Archive’s digital collections as one part of a multi-pronged strategy to address learner equity. Specifically, these online resources can be used to target issues of resource access, instructional rigor, and special needs access.

**Resource Access Considerations**
----------------------------------

-   **Book and Library Access**  
    By supplementing their onsite collections with online access to the Internet Archive’s [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/), schools can extend a wealth of resources to all learners in a digital learning space that is open 24/7. Books can either be borrowed for one hour or two weeks, depending on availability.

<!-- -->

-   **Diverse Resource Access**  
    Open Library offers diverse reading materials to represent its readers. It includes books from the curated [\#1000 Black Girl Books](https://archive.org/details/1000blackgirlbooks) list created by Marley Dias, a young girl determined to find books with main characters that looked like her. The collection includes books for younger readers like Karen Katz’ [The Colors of Us](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1989128W/The_colors_of_us) and Chris Cleave’s [Little Bee](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5845214W/Little_Bee) for older students.

**Instructional Rigor Considerations**
--------------------------------------

-   **Standards-Aligned Books**  
    Providing rigorous instruction is an important equity strategy. To support high quality teaching and learning, the Internet Archive collections include texts suggested by the [Common Core](http://www.corestandards.org/assets/Appendix_B.pdf) framework. For example, beginning readers can borrow books for reading aloud like Pat Mora’s [Tomas and the Library Lady](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1864488W/Tomas_and_the_Library_Lady), while middle schoolers can explore Mildred Taylor’s [Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16997550W/Roll_of_Thunder_Hear_me_Cry) and high schoolers can tackle [In the Time of Butterflies](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL116089W/In_the_Time_of_the_Butterflies) by Julia Alvarez.

<!-- -->

-   **Grade-Level Appropriate Books**  
    The Internet Archive’s digital libraries include [grade-level appropriate](https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360042654251-National-Emergency-Library-FAQs#h_02ddc58f-da50-4447-a1df-7ebae1bd9216) collections that teachers can use to ensure that all students are appropriately challenged with complex and quality texts.

**Special Needs Access**
------------------------

-   **Read Aloud and Print Disabled Books**  
    For students who need or prefer to listen to and visualize the plot of a story, Open Library provides a read aloud option. When viewing a borrowed book online, students can click on the audio speaker icon and choose their preferred reading speed. For those who are visually impaired and have special software, print disabled books have been formatted through [DAISY](https://openlibrary.org/help/faq/accessing). These tools can support school efforts to employ a [Universal Design for Learning](http://udlguidelines.cast.org/) approach. 

<!-- -->

-   **Print Disabled Collection**  
    To make access to print disabled books across the collection even easier to find, the Internet Archive has curated a Books for [People with Print Disabilities](https://archive.org/details/printdisabled) section. Over 1.5M books are accessible through this page and cover the wide range of topics available in the broader library from History and Science to Children’s literature. 

Working toward educational equity should be core to the mission of every school. By supporting resource access, instructional rigor, and special needs access, tools like the Internet Archive’s digital libraries can help schools move toward this essential goal.
