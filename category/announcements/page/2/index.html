<p>Posted on <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2021/08/25/graduate-student-internet-archive-an-absolutely-indispensable-resource/" title="12:00 pm">August 25, 2021</a><span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/caraleeadams/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by Caralee Adams">Caralee Adams</a></span></span></p>
<p>Although Casey Patterson spent much of the COVID-19 lockdown in a dank San Francisco basement apartment, he says he felt lucky in many ways.</p>
<p>The graduate student in English from Stanford University stayed healthy and—despite not having physical access to a library—was able to research his dissertation, teach classes, and prepare for job interviews. This was possible because of online access to materials through the Internet Archive.</p>

<p>Patterson, who is entering the sixth year of his doctoral program, offered to teach an online African American literature class to undergraduates as soon as COVID-19 shut down the campus and the university shifted to virtual instruction.</p>
<p>“I just felt a degree of duty to sign up for a lot of teaching. I wanted to be able to support students and knew the transition to online education was going to be rocky,” said Patterson, who also taught an Intro to Black Studies course during the pandemic. “It was chaotic. Obviously, we had a really tough time trying to figure out how to keep students engaged and make education a humane process.”</p>
<p>Instead of expecting students to buy several books, and without the ability for them to check out books in a library, Patterson turned to the Internet Archive. Patterson found works of Black critics such as Toni Morrison and C.L.R. James and their writings about 19<sup>th</sup> century authors Edgar Allen Poe and Herman Melville to use in class. He downloaded classics including <a href="https://archive.org/details/mobydick00melv_1">Moby Dick</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/adventuresofhuck00twai">Huckleberry Finn</a> to the Canvas learning management system and made them immediately available to students.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Using the Internet Archive, I could lay hands on basically everything I needed. It was an absolutely indispensable resource at the time.”</p>
<p>Casey Patterson, graduate student</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“It’s super helpful when you’re asking students to read 10 short passages from three different novels,” Patterson said of using the Internet Archive. “It would be cruel to ask them to buy all of the books or track them down to the library. This way you put them right at the students’ fingertips.”</p>
<p>Patterson also relied on text from the Internet Archive for his own research. For his dissertation, he is examining the role of educational history as a way of understanding African American literary studies and the institutionalization of Black studies as a discipline.</p>
<p>This spring, he interviewed for an academic job in which he was asked to prepare a lesson plan syllabus for a teaching demonstration. Having access to <a href="https://archive.org/details/bookofamericanne01john">The Book of American Negro Poetry</a>, works of African-American poet <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Wheatley%2C+Phillis%2C+1753-1784%22">Phillis Wheatley</a>, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/insearchofourmot0000walk">essays by Alice Walker</a> enabled Patterson to put together materials from the convenience of his apartment on a tight deadline.</p>

<p>“Using the Internet Archive, I could lay hands on basically everything I needed,” Patterson said. “It was an absolutely indispensable resource at the time,” he says.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2019, Patterson had used the Internet Archive in his Fandom research, another area of interest. He’d run across a citation to a website that was no longer available online and was able to track it down through the Wayback Machine. But since the pandemic, Patterson says he’s come to value the Internet Archive for its collection of primary sources.</p>
<p>“Knowledge is for everybody. The more we can do to break down the barriers that make it inaccessible, the better off everyone is,” said Patterson. “The Internet Archive is one great example of how we can do that almost with a click of a button.”</p>

<h2 id="a-library-of-everything">A Library of Everything</h2>
<p>As a young man, I wanted to help make a new medium that would be a step forward from Gutenberg’s invention hundreds of years before. </p>
<p>By building a Library of Everything in the digital age, I thought the opportunity was not just to make it available to everybody in the world, but to make it <em>better</em>–smarter than paper. By using computers, we could make the Library not just searchable, but organizable; make it so that you could navigate your way through millions, and maybe eventually billions of web pages.</p>
<p>The first step was to make computers that worked for large collections of rich media. The next was to create a network that could tap into computers all over the world: the Arpanet that became the Internet. Next came augmented intelligence, which came to be called search engines. I then helped build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_information_server">WAIS</a>–Wide Area Information Server–that helped publishers get online to anchor this new and open system, which came to be enveloped by the World Wide Web.  </p>
<p>By 1996, it was time to start building the library.</p>
<p>This library would have all the published works of humankind. This library would be available not only to those who could pay the $1 per minute that LexusNexus charged, or only at the most elite universities. This would be a library available to anybody, anywhere in the world. Could we take the role of a library a step further, so that everyone’s writings could be included–not only those with a New York book contract? Could we build a multimedia archive that contains not only writings, but also songs, recipes, games, and videos? Could we make it possible for anyone to learn about their grandmother in a hundred years’ time?</p>

<h2 id="not-about-an-exit-or-an-ipo">Not about an Exit or an IPO</h2>
<p>From the beginning, the Internet Archive had to be a nonprofit because it contains everybody else’s things. Its motives had to be transparent. It had to last a long time.</p>
<p>In Silicon Valley, the goal is to find a profitable exit, either through acquisition or IPO, and go off to do your next thing. That was never my goal. The goal of the Internet Archive is to create a permanent memory for the Web that can be leveraged to make a new Global Mind. To find patterns in the data over time that would provide us with new insights, well beyond what you could do with a search engine.  To be not only a historical reference but a living part of the pulse of the Internet.</p>

<h2 id="looking-way-back">Looking Way Back</h2>
<p>My favorite things from the early era of the Web were the dreamers. </p>
<p>In the early Web, we saw people trying to make a more democratic system work. People tried to make publishing more inclusive.</p>
<p>We also saw the other parts of humanity: the pornographers, the scammers, the spammers, and the trolls. They, too, saw the opportunity to realize their dreams in this new world. At the end of the day, the Internet and the World Wide Web–it’s just us. It’s just a history of humankind. And it has been an experiment in sharing and openness.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web at its best is a mechanism for people to share what they know, almost always for free, and to find one’s community no matter where you are in the world. </p>

<h2 id="looking-way-forward">Looking Way Forward</h2>
<p>Over the next 25 years, we have a very different challenge. It’s solving some of the big problems with the Internet that we’re seeing now. Will this be our medium or will it be theirs? Will it be for a small controlling set of organizations or will it be a common good, a public resource? </p>
<p>So many of us trust the Web to find recipes, how to repair your lawnmower, where to buy new shoes, who to date. Trust is perhaps the most valuable asset we have, and squandering that trust will be a global disaster. </p>
<p>We may not have achieved Universal Access to All Knowledge yet, but we still can.</p>
<p>In another 25 years, we can have writings from not a hundred million people, but from a billion people, preserved forever. We can have compensation systems that aren’t driven by advertising models that enrich only a few. </p>
<p>We can have a world with many winners, with people participating, finding communities of like-minded people they can learn from all over the world.  We can create an Internet where <em>we</em> feel in control. </p>
<p>I believe we can build this future together. You have already helped the Internet Archive build this future. Over the last 25 years, we’ve amassed billions of pages, 70 petabytes of data to offer to the next generation. Let’s offer it to them in new and exciting ways. Let’s be the builders and dreamers of the next twenty-five years.</p>

<p>Much of the art gallery, artist, and arts organization materials that were once published in print form are now available primarily or solely on the web. These groups, like many in the cultural sector, have also been hit especially hard by the global pandemic, making their web presences particularly at-risk of being lost if they are not proactively collected and preserved.The creation of reference and research resources that promote streamlined access and enable new types of scholarly use will ensure that the art historical record of the 21st century, and especially of our current global pandemic, is readily accessible far into the future.</p>

<p>NYARC are pioneers in collaborative web archiving and shared services, among art and museum libraries. NYARC’s robust web archive collections encompass art resources, artists’ websites, auction catalogs, catalogues raisonnes, and hundreds of New York City gallery websites. The Internet Archive and NYARC have partnered on work to build born-digital collecting capacity among arts organizations in the past, most recently in the IMLS-funded <a href="https://archive-it.org/blog/learn-more/art-libraries/">Advancing Art Libraries and Curated Web Archives</a> National forum and related events.  Through discussions, workshops and roadmapping sessions with leaders in art and museum libraries, a strategy and plan  towards an inclusive, sustainable, cooperative approach to collecting and stewarding born-digital, locally-focused art history collection was developed, forming the basis of this broader cooperative effort.</p>
<p>Members in the project’s preliminary group of art and museum libraries will select topics and specific web content that is relevant to their expertise, will provide metadata to facilitate access to archived content, and will participate in planning and evaluation meetings, all while curating a valuable reference resource that will enhance their traditional collecting areas. The Internet Archive will coordinate communications, facilitate governance and collective curatorial activities, provide technical digital library and archive services, and help enable members to build and maintain discovery and access platforms, as well as facilitate researcher use of the collections resulting from the group’s work.</p>
<p>If your art or museum library is interested in joining this collaborative effort, please fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNyceH86DmYU3Pcgz50CKWqDh_gbH0RmsrbZuz0ZOcSdyzUQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">participation form</a> by <strong>July 31</strong> to join us! </p>

<p>The Library of Congress <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/newsnet/2021/898.html">announced</a> that Brewster Kahle, Digital Librarian and founder of the Internet Archive, has been named to the Copyright Public Modernization Committee (CPMC), with a mission to help modernize the technology-related aspects of the U.S. Copyright Office. More specifically the CPMC will support “the development of the new Enterprise Copyright System (ECS), which includes the Office’s registration, recordation, public records, and licensing IT applications, and will be encouraged to help spread awareness of the Library’s development efforts more broadly.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/newsnet/2021/898.html">thirteen member panel</a> is composed of leaders from the library and university worlds along with representatives from trade organizations representing the recording and publishing industries, and corporate giants Amazon and Warner Media. Kahle, who holds a BS in Computer Science and Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, brings decades of experience in digital library issues, and is an inaugural member of the Internet Hall of Fame.  “I am excited to collaborate to help modernize the  U.S. Copyright Office.  Let’s see how far we can get,” says Kahle.</p>
<p>The first meeting of the CPMC is on July 22, 2021 from 1-4 PM eastern time and is open to the public, by <a href="https://loc.zoomgov.com/webinar/register/WN_cYWLGmi6QK-33JfrfrKS7w">registration</a> only. Register of Copyrights Shira Perlmutter and Library of Congress chief information officer Bud Barton will provide opening remarks, and Library subject-matter experts will provide an update on the development of ECS and other modernization efforts. Attendees will have an opportunity to hear directly from CPMC members and participate in a live Q&amp;A. The meeting will be recorded and made available for viewing after the event.</p>

<p>Johnson &amp; Wales University started as a business school in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1914, expanding over the years to offer 80 majors on multiple campuses.</p>
<p>In June 2021, declining enrollment led JWU to consolidate, closing its North Miami and Denver locations. This left the future of the university’s library collection at those sites in limbo. To save the collection, JWU Denver donated 33,000 books—primarily from its culinary and hospitality programs—to the Internet Archive to be preserved, digitized and many will be lent digitally.</p>
<p>Merrie Valliant, director of library services at JWU’s campus in Denver, curated the rich collection, encompassing titles dating back to the early 1900s. The hospitality section contains books on all aspects of the hotel and restaurant business including management, leadership, and accounting. There are books on menu planning, food science and nutrition. And the assortment of cookbooks covers global cuisines and novelties, including Balinese and Indonesian food, an Antarctic expedition cookbook from 1945 with recipes for penguins and walruses—and even books on just a single ingredient, such as strawberries.</p>
<p>“We had cookbooks from all countries, all states and every continent. If someone were to look for an interesting recipe of Jamaican jerk or a good creole recipe from Louisiana, they would be able to find it,” Valliant said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Internet Archive is going to keep it alive…It’s truly the library of the future…”</p>
<p>Merrie Valliant, director of library services, JWU Denver</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With JWU’s 12,000 students only attending classes now in Providence, Rhode Island, and Charlotte, North Carolina, the library needed to downsize, and donating was the best option, Valiant said. In addition to the hospitality books, the donation included books on sports and event management, as well as books on criminal justice, business, law, history and fashion design.</p>
<p>The collection is clearly a treasure, said Liz Rosenberg, manager of donations for the Internet Archive.</p>
<p>“Merrie had been the librarian caring for these books for the past 20 years and she shared her hope that more students might be able to continue being inspired by the collection,” Rosenberg said. “Her dedication to the library at the Johnson and Wales Denver campus and her students was what got the Internet Archive so excited about preserving this great collection. We are pleased it can live on digitally.”</p>

<p>In May, Valliant, student workers, and volunteers helped fill more than 900 boxes with books from the Denver library. The 45 pallets were transported to the Internet Archive where they will be preserved and queued for scanning. “I had cataloged and touched almost every book on the shelf,” Valliant said. “It really was difficult to watch it being driven away. It felt like a family saying goodbye to a distinct part of their life.”</p>
<p>Yet, the books will have a future audience for years to come.</p>
<p>“The Internet Archive is going to keep it alive,” Valliant said. “It’s truly the library of the future where you can access it 24/7/365 when you need it.  I think it’s wonderful that we’ve been able to contribute to that collection of information.”</p>

<p>Internet Archive’s <a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/">Community Webs</a> program is delighted to announce a partnership with the <a href="https://dp.la/">Digital Public Library of America</a> (DPLA) to ingest metadata from the over 700 publicly available Community Webs web archive collections into DPLA. These collections include thousands of archived websites and millions of individual web-published resources that document local history and underrepresented groups. The Internet Archive has been a DPLA content provider since 2015, primarily contributing content from our many print digitizing partnerships. Community Webs will also join DPLA as a member and we are excited for this opportunity to add hyperlocal born-digital and web collections from public libraries nationwide into DPLA’s national portal to cultural heritage collections.</p>

<p>The Community Webs program was launched in 2017 to provide training, infrastructure, services, and professional community cultivation for public librarians across the country for the purpose of documenting local history and community archiving, especially documenting communities and populaces traditionally excluded from the historical record. The program is in the midst of <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/12/08/community-webs-program-receives-1130000-andrew-w-mellon-foundation-award-for-a-national-network-of-public-libraries-building-local-history-web-archives/">nationwide expansion</a> and currently includes more than 100 member public libraries who are collaborating with local organizations, movements, and groups to document the lives and accomplishments of their citizens. The program continues to add new public libraries and cultural heritage organizations to support and scale their community archiving and has an open <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2021/06/10/community-webs-seeks-applicants-from-the-us-canada-and-around-the-world/">call for applications</a> in the US, Canada, and internationally for additional public libraries and local heritage organizations to join the program. Examples of Community Webs collections include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community Webs members have created more than 30 collections documenting local responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/13651">COVID-19 Coronavirus East Baton Rouge Parish</a> from East Baton Rouge Parish Library and Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture’s “<a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/13918">Novel Coronavirus COVID-19</a>” collection which focuses on “the African diasporan experiences of COVID-19 including racial disparities in health outcomes and access, the impact on Black-owned businesses, and cultural production.” </li>
<li>Community Webs members have created a number of collections documenting LGBTQ groups, events and other resources, including <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/11971">LGBTQIA/Hormel Resources</a> from San Francisco Public Library and Birmingham Public Library’s “<a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/10415">LGBTQ in Alabama</a>” collection.</li>
<li>Members are also actively archiving materials on their local or regional culture, such as Kansas City Public Library’s <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/9945">Arts &amp; Culture</a> collection, which “documents Kansas City’s thriving arts community, including galleries, museums, nonprofits, advocacy organizations, criticism and art spaces.”</li>
<li>Many members have focused on documenting local social services or advocacy groups, such as Madison Public Library’s <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/7941">Racial Equity and Social Justice, Madison, WI</a> collection of “organizations and non-profits that engage in public discourse on issues of racial equity and social justice.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Working with a mission-aligned organization like DPLA and our shared values of collaboration, open access, and community empowerment made it an obvious fit for Community Webs member collections to also be available in DPLA. Some public libraries who are a part of the Community Webs program are also members of local or statewide DPLA content hubs, and already have digitized content available in DPLA.The partnership between DPLA and Community Webs will ensure that archived web and born-digital collections are accessible alongside similar digitized materials for seamless discovery and access for uses. Pairing Community Webs’ free archiving, infrastructure, education, and other services with DPLA’s aggregation tools, hubs networks, and its advocacy role will help expand national access and capacity for making primary sources, and a more diverse archival record, accessible to any online user,</p>
<p>“DPLA’s new partnership with the Community Webs program will help further our mission to provide free digital access to cultural heritage artifacts that inform a truly representative history of our nation, “ said Shaneé Yvette Murrain, director of community engagement for DPLA. “We are thrilled to be deepening our work with Internet Archive through a program so perfectly aligned with our organizations’ shared values.”</p>
<p>“Pairing the community web archives of 100+ public libraries and the cohort cultivation that are part of Community Webs with the national scope and professional networks native to DPLA is a perfect match. We are excited to expand access to these amazing grassroots digital collections,” said Jefferson Bailey, Director of Web Archiving &amp; Data Services at Internet Archive.</p>
<p>We are excited to be partnering with DPLA to increase access to these vital community history collections and look forward to building more integrations and furthering this collaboration in the years to come.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.communia-association.org">COMMUNIA Association</a> is an international network of activists, researchers, and practitioners from around the world. Founded a decade ago, Communia advocates for policies that expand the public domain and increase access to culture and knowledge. Now, in celebration of its ten-year anniversary, Internet Archive is pleased to announce that it has <a href="https://www.communia-association.org/members/">officially joined Communia</a>.</p>
<p>At its founding, Communia issued <a href="https://www.communia-association.org/recommendations/">14 policy recommendations</a>. Broadly speaking, these recommendations stand for a balanced approach to copyright that would help expand access to knowledge. On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Communia held a series of <a href="https://vimeo.com/communia">events</a>, and launched a new <a href="https://10years.communia-association.org/">webpage</a>, to reflect on these recommendations in view of the past ten years of copyright policy and to consider what the future may hold.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Communia has continued to engage in the day-to-day work of advocating for a more balanced copyright. For instance, over the past several years, Communia has been a key voice regarding the European Union’s <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj">Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market</a>. Like <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/03/eus-parliament-signs-disastrous-internet-law-what-happens-next">many others,</a> we spoke out against many aspects of this new law. But the work did not stop there—as an EU Directive, this new law has to be <em>transposed</em> by each EU member state: implemented through passage of their own national laws. And because member states have discretion in how exactly to implement the directive, there has remained the important—but challenging—work of trying to guide its implementation in the best possible way. Communia took on this extraordinarily difficult task.</p>
<p>To do so (as they <a href="https://vimeo.com/561438061">recently explained</a>), Communia built a network of local advocates in each of the 27 member states. They then worked with these local advocates to try to guide the national implementations of the DSM directive so as to maximize access to knowledge and culture and the protection of users’ rights. More recently, they launched the <a href="https://eurovision.communia-association.org/">Eurovision DSM contest</a>, tracking the status of each member states’ implementation of the directive and scoring them along important metrics including transparency and safeguards for user rights. This is challenging and resource intensive work; as a result, the public interest often does not have a seat at the table. Communia ensures that it does.</p>
<p>So we congratulate Communia on its tenth anniversary, and are thrilled to support and join in its work. We look forward to working alongside <a href="https://www.openfuture.eu/">Open Future</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about">Creative Commons</a>, and all the others who have made Communia such an important voice in the copyright community over the past decade and are sure to do the same in the years to come.</p>

<p>The Government of Canada continues to consider fundamental changes to its copyright laws. In its <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/693.nsf/eng/00192.html">latest proposal</a>, what’s old is new again, as Canada once more considers automatic content filtering online. Internet Archive Canada strongly opposes these proposals, and submitted a formal <a href="https://archive.org/details/iac-submission-re-intermediary-liability-5.31.21">response</a> to the Government explaining why.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XtirUqrBLccddFiW69ludF66fguqBiNAyo-s-FJ7bIRdcjze3o915DYvQNLsmPpNQs5s-VKzJ3c_yr736ELkmJ0RLZSLkvsioKrdHSAH7TpQI0lnlPfYuulFZhl6W3IWynIHrBZ5" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, these are not new ideas. For over a decade, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/06/australia-heads-down-slippery-slope-authorizes">website blocking</a>, <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2021/03/09/internet-archive-expresses-concerns-over-sweeping-copyright-reform-proposal/">automatic content filtering</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090317101806/http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article4165519.ece">internet bans</a>, and other draconian copyright measures have been urged on governments around the world. With political leaders looking at large technology companies with a new eye, both the <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2016/06/02/copyright-offices-proposed-notice-and-staydown-system-would-force-the-internet-archive-and-other-platforms-to-censor-the-web/">United States</a> and the <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2018/06/12/proposed-eu-copyright-measure-threatens-the-internet/">European Union</a> have expressed a new openness to these <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/08/website-blocking-table-uk-least-now">previously rejected</a> ideas. Now <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2021/05/not-just-big-techbillc10/">styled</a> as attempts to reign in “big tech,” what is really at stake is the free and open internet, which offers so much to the individual user and makes websites like archive.org possible.</p>
<p>Fortunately, while the Government has outlined a variety of potentially troubling changes to Canada’s Copyright Act, it has also stated that “[s]ignificant changes” to Canada’s copyright law are “not presently being contemplated.” In the circumstances, Internet Archive Canada is simply asking the Government to recognize the tremendous significance of these kinds of proposals and refrain from enacting them at this time. Many others have done the same; indeed, our friends at <a href="https://openmedia.org/">Open Media</a> asked <a href="https://action.openmedia.org/page/81460/action/1?ea.tracking.id=om">all Canadians to voice their concerns</a> .</p>
<p>Internet Archive Canada is proud of its history in Canada, and we have often lauded Canada’s <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2019/06/04/the-future-of-canadian-copyright-looks-bright/">bright</a> and <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2018/12/11/working-to-keep-positive-copyright-provisions-in-canada/">positive</a> approach to copyright. We are hopeful that reason will once again prevail in the Canadian copyright debates, and that the Government of Canada will work to ensure good copyright policy and strong libraries in the 21st century and beyond.</p>

<p>The Internet Archive is seeking applicants for its next cohort of <a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/">Community Webs</a>!

<p>Community Webs provides infrastructure and services, training and education, and professional community cultivation for public libraries and cultural heritage organizations to document local history and the lives of their communities. <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2018/02/28/27-public-libraries-and-the-internet-archive-launch-community-webs-for-local-history-web-archiving/">Launched in the US in 2017</a> with kickoff funding from the <a href="https://www.imls.gov/">Institute of Museum and Library Services</a> (IMLS), Community Webs began <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/12/08/community-webs-program-receives-1130000-andrew-w-mellon-foundation-award-for-a-national-network-of-public-libraries-building-local-history-web-archives/">expanding nationally in 2020</a> with generous support from <a href="https://mellon.org/">The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>. Building on the program’s success and continued growth, Internet Archive is now supporting expansion of the program into Canada and to the international community, and is accepting applications for our next cohort kicking off in late-Summer 2021. <strong>The deadline for applications is August 2, 2021</strong>.</p>

<p>The program offers a unique opportunity for participating organizations to build capacity in digital collecting. Community Webs participants work alongside peer organizations and with their local communities to document the lives of their citizens, marginalized voices, and groups often absent from the historical record. All Community Webs participants receive: </p>
<ul>
<li>A guaranteed multi-year free subscription to the Archive-It web archiving service, which includes perpetual storage and access provided by the Internet Archive.</li>
<li>Access to additional Internet Archive non-profit services, such as digitization and digital preservation, either for free (as funding allows) or at or below actual cost.</li>
<li>Training and educational resources related to digital collections, web archiving, digital preservation, and other topics, as well as access to a cohort community pursuing similar work and to networking spaces, events, and knowledge sharing platforms.</li>
<li>The option to leverage program partnerships and integrations to include community web archives in other aggregators or access platforms beyond Internet Archive.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program currently includes over 100 public libraries from across the United States. These organizations have collectively archived over 70 terabytes of web-based community heritage materials. Some highlights include:</p>

<p>The benefits of the program are wide-ranging and impactful for both participants and their communities. As Community Webs member Makiba J. Foster of the African American Research Library and Cultural Center in Broward County, Florida stated during a recent Community Webs event, <a href="https://archive.org/details/archiving-the-black-diaspora"><em>Archiving the Black Diaspora</em></a>, “Community Webs provided me with the training, they provided me with the cohort support, […] provided me with services, and particularly it helped to develop an expertise for me in terms of creating collections of historically significant web materials documenting our local communities.” The program “allowed me to start a project of recovery and documentation of digitally born content related to the Black experience.” More information about what Foster and other Community Webs members are up to can be found by viewing our <a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/news.html">recent program announcements</a>.</p>
