<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to archive and provide perpetual access to at-risk, open-access scholarship, we have released Refcat (“reference” + “catalog”), the citation index culled from the catalog that underpins our <a href="https://scholar.archive.org/">IA Scholar</a> service for discovering the scholarly literature and research outputs within Internet Archive. This first release of the Refcat dataset contains over 1.3 billion citations extracted from over 60 million metadata records and over 120 million scholarly artifacts (articles, books, datasets, proceedings, code, etc) that IA Scholar has archived through web harvesting, digitization, integrations with other open knowledge services, and through partnerships and joint initiatives.</p>
<p>Refcat represents one of the larger citation graph datasets of scholarly literature, as well as uniquely containing a notable portion of citations from works that do not have a DOI or persistent identifier. We hope this dataset will be a valuable community resource alongside other critical knowledge graph projects, including those with which we are collaborating, such as <a href="https://opencitations.net/">OpenCitations</a> and <a href="http://wikicite.org/">Wikicite</a>. </p>
<p>The Refcat dataset is released under a CC0 license and is <a href="https://archive.org/details/refcat_2021-07-28">available for download from archive.org</a>. The related software created for the extraction and matching process, including exact and fuzzy citation matching (<a href="https://gitlab.com/internetarchive/refcat">refcat</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/internetarchive/fuzzycat/">fuzzycat</a>), are also released as open-source tools. For those interested in technical details about the project, a white paper is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06595">available on arxiv.org</a> authored by IA engineers, including Martin Czygan, who led work on Refcat, and is described in <a href="https://guide.fatcat.wiki/reference_graph.html">our catalog user guide</a>.</p>
<p>What does Refcat mean for regular users of IA Scholar? Refcat results from work to ensure the interconnection between material within IA Scholar and other resources archived in Internet Archive in order to make browsing and lookups easier and to ensure overall citation integrity and persistence. For example, there are over 25 million web links in the citations in Refcat and we were able to match ~14 million of these to archived web pages in <a href="http://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> and also found that ~18% of these matched web citations are no longer available on the live web. Web links in citations not in Wayback Machine have been added to ongoing web harvests. We also matched over 20 million citations to books that are available for lending in our <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> service and matched over 1 million citations to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> entries. </p>
<p>Besides interconnection, Refcat will allow users to understand what works have cited a specific scholarly resource (i.e. “cited by” or “inbound citations”) that will help with improved discovery features. Finally, knowing the full “knowledge graph” of IA Scholar helps us better identify important scholarly material that we have not yet archived, thus improving the overall quality and extent of the collection. This, in turn, aids scholars by ensuring their open-access work is archived and accessible forever, especially for those whose publisher may not have the resources for long-term preservation, and it ensures that related outputs like research registrations or datasets are also archived, matched to the article of record, and available into the future.</p>
<p>The Refcat release is a milestone of Phase Two of our project, “Ensuring the Persistent Access of Long Tail Open Access Journal Literature,” <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2018/03/05/andrew-w-mellon-foundation-awards-grant-to-the-internet-archive-for-long-tail-journal-preservation/">first announced in 2018</a> and supported by funding from the <a href="https://mellon.org/grants/grants-database/grants/internet-archive/1910-07256/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>. Current work focuses on citation integrity within the IA Scholar archive, partnerships and services, such as our role in the multi-institutional <a href="https://doaj.org/preservation/">Project Jasper</a> and our partnership with <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2019/09/24/internet-archive-and-center-for-open-science-collaborate-to-preserve-open-science-data/">Center for Open Science</a>, and the addition of secondary scholarly outputs to IA Scholar, including datasets, software, and other non-article/book scholarly materials. Lookout for a plethora of announcements about other IA Scholar milestones in the coming months!</p>

<p><a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/index.html">Community Webs</a>, the Internet Archive’s community history web and digital archiving program, is welcoming over 60 new members from across the US, Canada, and internationally. This new cohort is the first expansion of the Community Webs program outside of the United States and we are thrilled to be supporting the development of diverse, community-based web collections on an international scale. </p>
<p>Community Webs empowers cultural heritage organizations to collaborate with their communities to build web and digital archives of primary sources documenting local history and culture, especially collections inclusive of voices typically underrepresented in traditional memory collections. The program achieves this mission by providing its members with free access to the <a href="https://archive-it.org/">Archive-It</a> web archiving service, digital preservation and digitization services, and technical support and training in topics such as web archiving, community outreach, and digital preservation. The program also offers resources to support a local history archiving community of practice and to facilitate scholarly research.</p>
<p>New Community Webs member Karen Ng, Archivist at Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Úxwumixw (Squamish Nation), BC, Canada, notes that the program offers a way to capture community-generated online content in a context where many of the Nation’s records are held by other institutions. “The Squamish Nation community is active in creating and documenting language, traditional knowledge, and histories. Now more than ever in the digital age, it is imperative that these stories and histories be captured and stored in accessible ways for future generations.” </p>
<p>Similarly, for Maryna Chernyavska, Archivist at the Kule Folklore Centre in Edmonton, Canada, the program will allow the Centre to continue building relationships with community members and organizations. “Being able to assist local heritage organizations with web archiving will help us empower these communities to preserve their heritage based on their values and priorities, but also according to professional standards.”</p>
<p>The current expansion of the program was made possible in part by <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/12/08/community-webs-program-receives-1130000-andrew-w-mellon-foundation-award-for-a-national-network-of-public-libraries-building-local-history-web-archives/">generous funding from the Andrew Mellon Foundation</a>, which supports the growth of Community Webs to new public libraries in the US. Additional funding provided by the Internet Archive allows the program to reach cultural heritage organizations in Canada and beyond. This newest cohort brings the total number of participants in Community Webs to over 150 organizations, a ten-fold increase since the program’s inception in 2017. For a full list of new participants, see below. The program continues to add members – if your institution is interested in joining, please view our open <a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/about.html">calls for applications</a> and please make your favorite local memory organization aware of the opportunity.</p>
<p>Programming for the new cohort is underway and these members are already diving into the program’s educational resources and familiarizing themselves with the technical aspects of web archiving and digital preservation. We kicked things off recently with introductory Zoom sessions, where participants met one another and shared their organizations’ missions, communities served and goals for membership in the program. <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/enroll/GMD9G6">Online training modules</a>, developed by staff at the Internet Archive and the <a href="https://educopia.org/">Educopia Institute</a>, went live for new members at the beginning of September. And our new cohort joined our existing Community Webs partners at our virtual <a href="https://archive-it.org/blog/fall-2021-community-webs-virtual-partner-meeting/">Partner Meeting</a> on September 22nd. </p>
<p>We are thrilled to see the program continuing to grow and we look forward to working with our newest cohort. A warm welcome to the following new Community Webs members!</p>

<p>Much of the art gallery, artist, and arts organization materials that were once published in print form are now available primarily or solely on the web. These groups, like many in the cultural sector, have also been hit especially hard by the global pandemic, making their web presences particularly at-risk of being lost if they are not proactively collected and preserved.The creation of reference and research resources that promote streamlined access and enable new types of scholarly use will ensure that the art historical record of the 21st century, and especially of our current global pandemic, is readily accessible far into the future.</p>

<p>For this reason, the Internet Archive, along with the <a href="https://nyarc.org/">New York Art Resources Consortium</a> (NYARC), are pleased to announce our project <em>Consortial Action to Preserve Born-Digital, Web-Based Art History &amp; Culture.</em> The project recently received a two-year, $305,343 Humanities Collections and Reference Resources grant from the Division of Preservation and Access at the <a href="https://www.neh.gov/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a>. This award will support the formation of a cooperative group of 30+ art and museum libraries from across the United States to collaborate on the preservation of, and access to vital arts content from the web. </p>
<p>The Internet Archive has a long history of building and supporting collaborative communities and providing non-profit web, preservation, and access services to cultural heritage organizations. The multi-institutional initiative between Internet Archive, NYARC, and other arts and museum organizations will build on similar community-based archiving and professional cultivation projects in the Community Programs group, especially our <a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/about.html">Community Webs</a> program, <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2021/06/10/community-webs-seeks-applicants-from-the-us-canada-and-around-the-world/">currently expanding nationally and internationally</a>. Community Webs has <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/12/08/community-webs-program-receives-1130000-andrew-w-mellon-foundation-award-for-a-national-network-of-public-libraries-building-local-history-web-archives/">received funding from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and IMLS</a> to provide public libraries and cultural heritage organizations with services, training, and professional development opportunities to document their diverse local history. </p>
<p>NYARC are pioneers in collaborative web archiving and shared services, among art and museum libraries. NYARC’s robust web archive collections encompass art resources, artists’ websites, auction catalogs, catalogues raisonnes, and hundreds of New York City gallery websites. The Internet Archive and NYARC have partnered on work to build born-digital collecting capacity among arts organizations in the past, most recently in the IMLS-funded <a href="https://archive-it.org/blog/learn-more/art-libraries/">Advancing Art Libraries and Curated Web Archives</a> National forum and related events.  Through discussions, workshops and roadmapping sessions with leaders in art and museum libraries, a strategy and plan  towards an inclusive, sustainable, cooperative approach to collecting and stewarding born-digital, locally-focused art history collection was developed, forming the basis of this broader cooperative effort.</p>
<p>Members in the project’s preliminary group of art and museum libraries will select topics and specific web content that is relevant to their expertise, will provide metadata to facilitate access to archived content, and will participate in planning and evaluation meetings, all while curating a valuable reference resource that will enhance their traditional collecting areas. The Internet Archive will coordinate communications, facilitate governance and collective curatorial activities, provide technical digital library and archive services, and help enable members to build and maintain discovery and access platforms, as well as facilitate researcher use of the collections resulting from the group’s work.</p>
<p>If your art or museum library is interested in joining this collaborative effort, please fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNyceH86DmYU3Pcgz50CKWqDh_gbH0RmsrbZuz0ZOcSdyzUQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">participation form</a> by <strong>July 31</strong> to join us! </p>

<p>The Internet Archive’s <a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/">Community Webs</a> Program provides training and education, infrastructure and services, and professional community cultivation for public librarians across the country to document their local history and the lives of their patrons. Following our <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/12/08/community-webs-program-receives-1130000-andrew-w-mellon-foundation-award-for-a-national-network-of-public-libraries-building-local-history-web-archives/">recent announcement</a> of the program’s national expansion, with support from the <a href="https://mellon.org">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>, we are excited to welcome the first class of 50+ new public libraries to the program. This brings the current number of new and returning Community Webs participants to 90+ libraries from 33 states and 3 US territories. This diverse group of organizations includes multiple state libraries representing their regions, as well as a mix of large metropolitan library systems, small libraries in rural areas, and libraries like the Feleti Barstow Public Library in American Samoa. All will be working to document their communities, with a particular focus on archiving materials from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>The new cohort class kicked off with virtual introductory events in mid-March, where participants met one another and shared stories about their communities and their goals for preserving and providing access to local history materials. Member libraries are currently receiving training in topics such as collection development and starting to build digital collections that reflect local diversity, events, and culture.</p>
<p>Program participant Kathleen Pickering, Director of the Belen Public Library and Harvey House Museum in Belen, New Mexico notes that their library “is committed to free and open-source electronic resources for our patrons, especially given the low-income status of many of our residents” and Community Webs will help further that goal. Similarly, new cohort member Aaron Ramirez of Pueblo City-County Library District (PCCLD) found Community Webs to be a great fit for existing institutional goals and initiatives. “PCCLD’s five-year strategic plan directs us to embrace local cultures, to include individuals of all skill levels and physical abilities, and to enrich established partnerships and collaborations. The groups that have not seen themselves in our archives will find through this project PCCLD’s intention and means to listen and go forward as allies and as a resource of support, rather than an institution serving only the affluent.”</p>

Foster, Manager of The African American Research Library and Cultural Center of Broward County, Florida pointed out that “as content becomes increasingly digital, we need this opportunity to document the digital life and content of our community which includes a diverse representation of the Black Diaspora.”  Makiba was a member of the original Community Webs cohort in a previous position at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at New York Public Library, and recently <a href="https://archive.org/details/archiving-the-black-diaspora">presented</a> on her work archiving the black diaspora to a group of more than 200 attendees.</p>
<p>The Community Webs Program is continuing to grow towards the milestone of over 150 participating libraries across the United States and will soon announce another call for applicants for a U.S. cohort starting in late summer. The program also is beginning to expand internationally, starting in Canada, exploring the addition of other types of libraries and cultural heritage organizations, and expanding its suite of training and services available to participants. Expect more news on these initiatives soon. </p>

<p>In July, we announced our <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/07/28/archive-it-and-archives-unleashed-join-forces-to-scale-research-use-of-web-archives/">partnership with the Archives Unleashed</a> project as part of our ongoing effort to make new services available for scholars and students to study the archived web. Joining the curatorial power of our <a href="https://archive-it.org/">Archive-It</a> service, our work <a href="http://blog.archive.org/tag/web-data-research/">supporting text and data mining</a>, and <a href="https://archivesunleashed.org/">Archives Unleashed’s</a> in-browser analysis tools will open up new opportunities for understanding the petabyte-scale volume of historical records in web archives.</p>

<p>As part of our partnership, we are releasing a series of publicly available datasets created from archived web collections. Alongside these efforts, the project is also launching a Cohort Program providing funding and technical support for research teams interested in studying web archive collections. These twin efforts aim to help build the infrastructure and services to allow more researchers to leverage web archives in their scholarly work. More details on the new public datasets and the cohorts program are below. </p>
<p><strong>Early Web Datasets</strong></p>
<p>Our first in a series of public datasets from the web collections are oriented around the theme of the early web. These are, of course, datasets intended for data mining and researchers using computational tools to study large amounts of data, so are absent the informational or nostalgia value of looking at archived webpages in the Wayback Machine. If the latter is more your interest, here is an archived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040312165034/http://www.geocities.com/linda6619/caitlinsgraphics.html">Geocities page with unicorn GIFs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>GeoCities Collection (1994–2009)</strong></p>
<p>As one of the first platforms for creating web pages without expertise, Geocities lowered the barrier of entry for a new generation of website creators. There were at least 38 million pages displayed by GeoCities before it was terminated by Yahoo! in 2009. This dataset collection contains a number of individual datasets that include data such as domain counts, image graph and web graph data, and binary file information for a variety of file formats like audio, video, and text and image files. A graphml file is also available for the domain graph.</p>
<p>GeoCities Dataset Collection: <a href="https://archive.org/details/geocitiesdatasets" class="uri">https://archive.org/details/geocitiesdatasets</a></p>
<p><strong>Friendster (2003–2015)</strong></p>
<p>Friendster was an early and widely used social media networking site where users were able to establish and maintain layers of shared connections with other users. This dataset collection contains  graph files that allow data-driven research to explore how certain pages within Friendster linked to each other. It also contains a dataset that provides some basic metadata about the individual files within the archival collection. </p>
<p>Friendster Dataset Collection: <a href="https://archive.org/details/friendsterdatasets" class="uri">https://archive.org/details/friendsterdatasets</a></p>
<p><strong>Early Web Language Datasets (1996–1999)</strong></p>
<p>These two related datasets were generated from the Internet Archive’s global web archive collection. The first dataset, “Parallel Language Records of the Early Web (1996–1999)” provides a dataset of multilingual records, or URLs of websites that have the same text represented in multiple languages. Such multi-language text from websites are a rich source for parallel language corpora and can be valuable in machine translation. The second dataset, “Language Annotations of the Early Web (1996–1999)” is another metadata set that annotates the language of over four million websites using Compact Language Detector (CLD3).</p>

<p>Looking for a research paper but can’t find a copy in your library’s catalog or popular search engines? Give <a href="https://scholar.archive.org">Internet Archive Scholar</a> a try! We might have a PDF from a “vanished” Open Access publisher in our web archive, an author’s pre-publication manuscript from their archived faculty webpage, or a digitized microfilm version of an older publication.</p>
<p>We hope Internet Archive Scholar will aid researchers and librarians looking for specific open access papers that may not be otherwise available to them. Judith van Stegeren (<span class="citation" data-cites="jd7g">[@jd7g]</span>(https://twitter.com/jd7h) on Twitter), a PhD candidate in the Netherlands, encountered just such a situation recently <a href="https://twitter.com/jd7h/status/1362413265213677570">when sharing a workshop paper</a> on procedural generation in computer games: “Towards Qualitative Procedural Generation” by Mark R. Johnson, originally presented at the Computational Creativity &amp; Games Workshop in 2016. The papers for this particular year of the workshop are not indexed in the usual bibliographic catalogs, and the original workshop website hosting the Open Access papers is no longer accessible. Fortunately, copies of all the 2016 workshop papers were captured in the Wayback Machine, and can be found today by <a href="https://scholar.archive.org/search?q=journal%3A%22Computational+Creativity+Games+Workshop%22">searching IA Scholar by title or conference name</a>.</p>
<p>As another example, dozens of papers from the <em>Open Journal of Hematology</em> are no longer resolvable via DOI. As mentioned in a <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/09/15/how-the-internet-archive-is-ensuring-permanent-access-to-open-access-journal-articles/">previous blog post</a>, the publisher’s website vanished and has been replaced with unrelated advertisements. But before that happened, the papers were captured in the Wayback Machine, <a href="https://fatcat.wiki/container/plhitgzuq5e6tmtd5ue4sff7ua">indexed in our catalog</a>, and can now be searched in full:</p>

IA Scholar Search Results
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>IA Scholar is a simple, access-oriented interface to content identified across several Internet Archive collections, including web archives, archive.org files, and digitized print materials. The full text of articles is searchable for users that are hunting for particular phrases or keywords. This complements our <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=&amp;sin=TXT">existing full-text search index</a> of millions of digitized books and other documents on archive.org.</p>
<p>The service builds on <a href="https://fatcat.wiki/">Fatcat</a>, an open catalog we have developed to identify at-risk and web-published open scholarly outputs that can benefit from long-term preservation, additional metadata, and perpetual access. Fatcat includes resources that may be useful to librarians and archivists, such as bulk metadata dumps, a read/write API, command-line tool, and file-level archival metadata. If you are interested in collaborating with us, or are a researcher interested in text analysis applications, we have a <a href="https://gitter.im/internetarchive/fatcat">public chat channel</a> or can be contacted by email at info@archive.org.</p>
<p>IA Scholar marks a milestone in our work initiated in 2018 to leverage the automation and scale of web and API harvesting in providing open infrastructure for the preservation of and perpetual access to scholarly materials from the public web. We particularly want to thank the Mellon Foundation for <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2018/03/05/andrew-w-mellon-foundation-awards-grant-to-the-internet-archive-for-long-tail-journal-preservation/">their original and ongoing support of this work,</a> our many current partners, and the other collaborators, contributors, and volunteers.</p>
<p>All of this is possible because of the incredible open research ecosystem built and collectively maintained by Open Access advocates. Thank you to the <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/11/05/internet-archive-participates-in-doaj-led-collaboration-to-improve-the-preservation-of-oa-journals/">DOAJ and other groups</a> for helping catalog open access journals which has aided preservation. Thank you to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/biodiversity">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a> and its supporters for digitizing print journal literature. And thank you to the many other organizations we have worked with, integrated, or whose services we have utilized, including open web indices (<a href="http://unpaywall.org/">Unpaywall</a>, <a href="https://core.ac.uk/">CORE</a>, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/">CiteseerX</a>, <a href="https://academic.microsoft.com/home">Microsoft Academic</a>, <a href="http://semanticscholar.org">Semantic Scholar</a>), directories of open journals (<a href="https://doaj.org/">DOAJ</a>, <a href="https://road.issn.org/">ROAD</a> <a href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/about.html">SHERPA/ROMEO</a>, <a href="https://jurnsearch.wordpress.com/directory/">JURN</a>, <a href="http://wikidata.org">Wikidata</a>), and open bibliographic catalogs (<a href="http://crossref.org">Crossref</a>, <a href="https://datacite.org/">Datacite</a>, <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/">J-STAGE</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.gov/">Pubmed</a>, <a href="https://dblp.org/">dblp</a>). </p>
<p>IA Scholar is built from open source software components, and is itself <a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/fatcat-scholar">released as Free Software</a>. The website has been <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/internetarchive/">translated into eight languages (so far!)</a> by generous volunteers.</p>

<p>Local history collections are necessary to understanding the life and culture of a community. As methods for sharing  information have shifted towards the web, there are many more avenues for community members to document diverse experiences.  Public libraries play a critical role in building community-oriented archives and these collections  are particularly important in recording the impact of unprecedented events on the lives of local citizens. </p>

<p>The program is seeking public libraries to join a diverse network of 150+ organizations  that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documenting local history by saving web-published sites, stories and community engagement on the web.</li>
<li>Growing their professional skills and increasing institutional technical capacity by engaging in a supportive network of peer organizations pursuing this work.</li>
<li>Building a public understanding of web archiving as a practice and its importance to preserving 21st century community history and underrepresented voices.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/participants.html">Current Community Webs cohort members</a> have created nearly 300 publicly available local history web archive collections on topics ranging from <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/13918">COVID-19</a>, to local <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/9945">arts and culture</a>, to <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/13134">2020 local and U.S. elections</a>. Collecting the web-published materials of local organizations, movements and individuals is often the primary way to document their presence for future historians.</p>

<p>More than ever, the lives of communities are documented online. The web remains a vital resource for traditionally under-represented groups to write and share about their lives and experiences. Preserving this web-published material, in turn, allows libraries to build more expansive, inclusive, and community-oriented archival collections.</p>

<p>In 2017, the Internet Archive’s Archive-It service launched the program, “<a href="http://blog.archive.org/2018/02/28/27-public-libraries-and-the-internet-archive-launch-community-webs-for-local-history-web-archiving/">Community Webs: Empowering Public Libraries to Create Community History Web Archives</a>.” The program provides training, professional development, cohort building, and technical services for public librarians to curate community archives of websites, social media, and online material documenting the experiences of their patrons, especially those often underrepresented in traditional physical archives. Since its launch, the program has grown to include <a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/participants.html">40 public libraries in 21 states</a> that have built almost 300 collections documenting local civic life, especially of marginalized groups, creating an archive totaling over 50 terabytes and tens of millions of individual digital documents, images, audio-video, and more. The program received <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/03/10/community-webs-receives-additional-funding-to-further-public-library-local-history-web-collecting/">additional funding in 2019</a> to continue its work and focus on strategic planning, partnering with the <a href="https://educopia.org">Educopia Institute</a> to ensure the growth and sustainability of the program and the cohort.</p>
<p>We are excited to announce that Community Webs has received $1,130,000 in funding from <a href="https://mellon.org/programs/public-knowledge/">The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a> for “Community Webs: A National Network of Public Library Web Archives Documenting Local History &amp; Underrepresented Groups,” an nationwide expansion of the program to include a minimum of 2 public libraries in each of the 50 United States, plus additional local history organizations in U.S territories, for a total of 150-200 participating public libraries and heritage organizations. Participants will receive web archiving and access services, training and education, and funds to promote and pursue their community archiving. The Community Webs National Network will also make the resulting public library local history community web archives available to scholars through specialized access tools and datasets, partner with affiliated national discovery and digital collections platforms such as <a href="https://dp.la">DPLA</a>, and build partnerships and collaborations with state and regional groups advancing local history digital preservation efforts. We thank The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for their generous support to grow this program nationwide and empower hundreds of public librarians to build archives that elevate the voices, lives, and events of their underrepresented communities and ensure this material is permanently available to patrons, students, scholars, and citizens.</p>
<p>Over the course of the Community Webs program, participating public libraries have created diverse collections on a wide range of topics, often in collaboration with members of their local communities. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community Webs members have created collections related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture’s “<a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/13918">Novel Coronavirus COVID-19</a>” collection which focuses on “the African diasporan experiences of COVID-19 including racial disparities in health outcomes and access, the impact on Black-owned businesses, and cultural production.” Athens Regional Library System created a collection of “<a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/13711">Athens, Georgia Area COVID-19 Response</a>” which focuses on the social, economic and health impacts of COVID-19 on the local community, with specific attention on community efforts to support frontline workers. A recent <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20201102185901/https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/2020/11/02/collecting-coronavirus-stories/">American Libraries article</a> featured the COVID archiving work of public libraries.</li>
<li>Columbus Metropolitan Library’s archive of “<a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/9697">Immigrant Experience</a>”, a collection of websites on the activities, needs, and culture of immigrant communities in Central Ohio.</li>
<li>Sonoma County Public Library’s “<a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/9742">North Bay Fires, 2017</a>” collection documenting when “devastating firestorms swept through Sonoma, Napa, and Mendocino Counties” and part of their “<a href="https://sonomalibrary.org/sonoma-responds-community-archive">Sonoma Responds: Community Memory Archive</a>.”</li>
<li>Birmingham Public Library’s “<a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/10415">LGBTQ in Alabama</a>” collection “documenting the history and experiences of the LGBTQ community in Alabama.”</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Since 2017, Internet Archive has pursued dedicated technical and partnership work to help preserve and provide perpetual access to open access scholarly literature and other outputs. See our <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2018/03/05/andrew-w-mellon-foundation-awards-grant-to-the-internet-archive-for-long-tail-journal-preservation/">original announcement</a> related to this work and a recent <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/09/15/how-the-internet-archive-is-ensuring-permanent-access-to-open-access-journal-articles/">update on progress</a>. The below official press release announces an exciting new multi-institutional collaboration in this area.</em></p>
<p>The Directory of Open Access Journals (<a href="https://doaj.org">DOAJ</a>), the <a href="https://clockss.org/">CLOCKSS Archive</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, <a href="https://keepers.issn.org/">Keepers Registry</a>/ISSN International Centre and <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/">Public Knowledge Project</a> (PKP) have agreed to partner to provide an alternative pathway for the preservation of small-scale, APC-free, Open Access journals.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11933">The recent study</a> authored by M.Laakso, L.Matthias, and N.Jahn has revived academia’s concern over the disappearance of the scholarly record disseminated in Open Access (OA) journals.</p>
<p>Their research focuses on OA journals as at risk of vanishing, and “especially small-scale and APC-free journals […] with limited financial resources” that often “opt for lightweight technical solutions” and “cannot afford to enroll in preservation schemes.” The authors have used data available in the Directory of Open Access Journals to come up with the conclusion that just under half of the journals indexed in DOAJ participate in preservation schemes. Their findings “suggest that current approaches to digital preservation are successful in archiving content from larger journals and established publishing houses but leave behind those that are more at risk.” They call for new preservation initiatives “to develop alternative pathways […] better suited for smaller journals that operate without the support of large, professional publishers.”</p>
<p>Answering that call, the joint initiative proposed by the five organisations aims at offering an affordable archiving option to OA journals with no author fees (“diamond” OA) registered with DOAJ, as well as raising awareness among the editors and publishers of these journals about the importance of enrolling with a preservation solution. DOAJ will act as a single interface with CLOCKSS, PKP and Internet Archive and facilitate a connection to these services for interested journals. Lars Bjørnhauge, DOAJ Managing Editor, said: “That this group of organisations are coming together to find a solution to the problem of “vanishing” journals is exciting. It comes as no surprise that journals with little to no funding are prone to disappearing. I am confident that we can make a real difference here.”</p>
<p>Reports regarding the effective preservation of the journals’ content will be aggregated by the ISSN International Centre (ISSN IC) and published in the Keepers Registry. Gaëlle Béquet, ISSN IC Director, commented: “As the operator of the Keepers Registry service, the ISSN International Centre receives inquiries from journal publishers looking for archiving solutions. This project is a new step in the development of our service to meet this need in a transparent and diverse way involving all our partners.”</p>
<p>About 50% of the journals identified by DOAJ as having no archiving solution in place use the Open Journal System (OJS). Therefore, the initiative will also identify and encourage journals on PKP’s OJS platform to preserve their content in the PKP Preservation Network (PKP PN), or to use another supported solution if the OJS instance isn’t new enough to be compatible with the PN integration (OJS 3.1.2+). </p>
<p>The partners will then follow up by assessing the success and viability of the initiative with an aim to open it up to new archiving agencies and other groups of journals indexed in DOAJ to consolidate preservation actions and ensure service diversity.</p>
<p>DOAJ will act as the central hub where publishers will indicate that they want to participate. Archiving services, provided by CLOCKSS, Internet Archive and PKP will expand their existing capacities. These agencies will report their metadata to the Keepers Registry to provide an overview of the archiving efforts. </p>
<p>Project partners are currently exploring business and financial sustainability models and outlining areas for technical collaboration.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://doaj.org/">DOAJ</a> is a community-curated list of peer-reviewed, open access journals and aims to be the starting point for all information searches for quality, peer reviewed open access material. DOAJ’s mission is to increase the visibility, accessibility, reputation, usage and impact of quality, peer-reviewed, open access scholarly research journals globally, regardless of discipline, geography or language. DOAJ will work with editors, publishers and journal owners to help them understand the value of best practice publishing and standards and apply those to their own operations. DOAJ is committed to being 100% independent and maintaining all of its services and metadata as free to use or reuse for everyone.</p>
<p>CLOCKSS is a not-for-profit joint venture among the world’s leading academic publishers and research libraries whose mission is to build a sustainable, international, and geographically distributed dark archive with which to ensure the long-term survival of Web-based scholarly publications for the benefit of the greater global research community. <a href="https://www.clockss.org" class="uri">https://www.clockss.org</a>.</p>
<p>Internet Archive is a non-profit digital library, top 200 website at <a href="https://archive.org/" class="uri">https://archive.org/</a>, and archive of over 60PB of millions of free books, movies, software, music, websites, and more. The Internet Archive partners with over 800 libraries, universities, governments, non-profits, scholarly communications, and open knowledge organizations around the world to advance the shared goal of “Universal Access to All Knowledge.” Since 2017, Internet Archive has pursued partnerships and technical work with a focus on preserving all publicly accessible research outputs, especially at-risk, open access journal literature and data, and providing mission-aligned, non-commercial open infrastructure for the preservation of scholarly knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="https://keepers.issn.org/">Keepers Registry</a> hosted by the ISSN International Centre, an intergovernmental organisation under the auspices of UNESCO, is a global service that monitors the archiving arrangements for continuing resources including e-serials. A dozen archiving agencies all around the world currently report to Keepers Registry. The Registry has three main purposes: 1/ to enable librarians, publishers and policy makers to find out who is looking after what e-content, how, and with what terms of access; 2/ to highlight e-journals which are still “at risk of loss” and need to be archived; 3/ to showcase the archiving organizations around the world, i.e. the Keepers, which provide the digital shelves for access to content over the long term.</p>
<p><a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/">PKP</a> is a multi-university and long-standing research project that develops (free) open source software to improve the quality and reach of scholarly publishing. For more than twenty years, PKP has played an important role in championing open access. Open Journal Systems (OJS) was released in 2002 to help reduce cost as a barrier to creating and consuming scholarship online. Today, it is the world’s most widely used open source platform for journal publishing: approximately 42% of the journals in the DOAJ identify OJS as their platform/host/aggregator. In 2014, PKP launched its own Private LOCKSS Network (now the PKP PN) to offer OJS journals unable to invest in digital preservation a free, open, and trustworthy service. </p>

<p>Posted on <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/09/15/how-the-internet-archive-is-ensuring-permanent-access-to-open-access-journal-articles/" title="5:35 pm">September 15, 2020</a><span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/bnewbold/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by bnewbold">bnewbold</a></span></span></p>
<p><em>Internet Archive has archived and identified 9 million open access journal articles– the next 5 million is getting harder</em></p>
<p>Open Access journals, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190520161038/http:/newtheologyreview.org:80/index.php/ntr/issue/archive">New Theology Review</a> (ISSN: 0896-4297) and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190621023739/http://rossscience.org/ojhmt/index.php">Open Journal of Hematology</a> (ISSN: 2075-907X), made their research articles available for free online for years. With a quick click or a simple query, students anywhere in the world could access their articles, and diligent Wikipedia editors could verify facts against original articles on vitamin deficiency and blood donation.  </p>
<p>But some journals, such as these titles, are no longer available from the publisher’s websites, and are only available through the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Since 2017, the Internet Archive joined others in concentrating on archiving all scholarly literature and making it permanently accessible.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web has made it easier than ever for scholars to collaborate, debate, and share their research. Unfortunately, the structure of today’s web means that content can disappear just as easily: as of today the official publisher websites and DOI redirects for both of the above journals go nowhere or have been replaced with unrelated content.</p>

<p>Vigilant librarians saw this problem coming decades ago, when the print-to-digital migration was getting started. They insisted that commercial publishers work with contract digital preservation organizations (such as Portico, LOCKSS, and CLOCKSS) to ensure long-term access to expensive journal subscription content. Efforts have been made to preserve open articles as well, such as Public Knowledge Project’s <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-pn/">Private LOCKSS Network</a> for OJS journals and national hosting platforms like the <a href="https://www.scielo.br/">SciELO</a> network. But a portion of all scholarly articles continues to fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>Researchers found that 176 open access journals have already vanished from their publishers’ website over the past two decades, according to a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11933">preprint article</a> by Mikael Laakso, Lisa Matthias, and Najko Jahn. These periodicals were from all regions of the world and represented all major disciplines — sciences, humanities and social sciences. There are over 14,000 open access journals indexed by the <a href="https://doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> and the paper suggests another 900 of those are inactive and at risk of disappearing. The pre-print has struck a nerve, receiving news coverage in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-02610-z">Nature</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abe6998">Science</a>.</p>
<p>In 2017, with <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2018/03/05/andrew-w-mellon-foundation-awards-grant-to-the-internet-archive-for-long-tail-journal-preservation/">funding support from the Andrew Mellon Foundation</a> and the Kahle/Austin Foundation, the Internet Archive launched a project focused on preserving all publicly accessible research documents, with a particular focus on open access materials. Our first job was to quantify the scale of the problem.</p>

</figure>
<p>Of the 14.8 million known open access articles published since 1996, the Internet Archive has archived, identified, and made available through the Wayback Machine 9.1 million of them (“bright” green in the chart above). In the jargon of Open Access, we are counting only “gold” and “hybrid” articles which we expect to be available directly from the publisher, as opposed to preprints, such as in <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arxiv.org</a> or institutional repositories. Another 3.2 million are believed to be preserved by one or more contracted preservation organizations, based on records kept by <a href="https://keepers.issn.org/stats">Keepers Registry</a> (“dark” olive in the chart). These copies are not intended to be accessible to anybody unless the publisher becomes inaccessible, in which case they are “triggered” and become accessible.</p>
<p>This leaves at least 2.4 million Open Access articles at risk of vanishing from the web (“None”, red in the chart). While many of these are still on publisher’s websites, these have proven difficult to archive.</p>
<p>One of our goals is to archive as many of the articles on the open web as we can, and to keep up with the growing stream of new articles published every day. Another is to look back over the vast petabytes of web content in the Wayback Machine, back to 1996, and find any content we might already have but is not easily findable or discoverable. Both of these projects are amenable to software automation, but made more difficult by the evolving nature of HTML and PDFs and their diverse character sets and encodings. To that end, we have approached this project not just as a technical one, but also as a collaborative one that aims to add another piece to the distributed infrastructure supporting open scholarship.</p>
<p>To expand our reach, we built an editable catalog (<a href="https://fatcat.wiki" class="uri">https://fatcat.wiki</a>) with an open API to allow anybody to contribute. As the software is free and open source, as is the data, we invite others to reuse and link to the content we have archived. We have also <a href="https://scholar-qa.archive.org/">indexed and made searchable</a> much of the literature to help manage our work and help others find if we have archived particular articles. We want to make scholarly material permanently available, and available in new ways– including via large datasets for analysis and “meta research.” </p>
<p>We also want to acknowledge the many partnerships and collaborations that have supported this work, many of which are key parts of the open scholarly infrastructure, including ISSN, DOAJ, LOCKSS, Unpaywall, Semantic Scholar, CiteSeerX, Crossref, Datacite, and many others. We also want to acknowledge the many Internet Archive staff and volunteers that have contributed to this work, including Bryan Newbold, Martin Czygan, Paul Baclace, Jefferson Bailey, Kenji Nagahashi, David Rosenthal, Victoria Reich, Ellen Spertus, and others.</p>
