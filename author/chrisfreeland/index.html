<p>The Internet Archive Hero Award is an annual award that recognizes those who have exhibited leadership in making information available for digital learners all over the world. Previous recipients have included librarian and professor of law <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/10/20/michelle-wu-receives-internet-archive-hero-award-for-establishing-the-legal-basis-for-controlled-digital-lending/">Michelle Wu</a>, <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/23/unlocking-the-potential-for-every-high-school-library-2019-internet-archive-hero-award/">Phillips Academy</a>, the <a href="https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2015/11/bhl-receives-internet-archives-internet.html">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a>, and the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/grateful-dead-win-internet-hero-award-for-viral-marketing/">Grateful Dead</a>.</p>
<p>This year, we were looking for libraries and librarians who rose to the challenge—this was the year that libraries and librarians have been needed like never before. We wanted to acknowledge the hard work of people who went above and beyond to meet the needs of their communities.</p>
<p>Kanta and Lisa both exemplify the spirit of an Internet Archive Hero:</p>
<ul>
<li>They helped both of their organizations become early adopters of Controlled Digital Lending in 2019. Of course no one knew it at the time, but that early move helped their patrons stay connected to resources throughout library closures of 2020 and 2021 by already having tens of thousands of digitized books available through each library’s participation in the Internet Archive’s <a href="http://openlibraries.online/">Open Libraries</a> program.</li>
<li>They donated collections to the Internet Archive that no longer fit their library’s local collection development priorities, so that we could preserve and digitize the books, and make them available to digital learners everywhere. You can learn more about the <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2021/05/26/behind-the-curtain-of-the-hamilton-public-library-theater-book-donation/">theater books donated from Hamilton Public Library</a> and the <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2021/03/10/milton-public-library-reaches-patrons-through-controlled-digital-lending/">30,000 books donated by Milton Public Library</a>.</li>
<li>They were resources to their professional networks, acting as a point of reference for other librarians interested in learning more about Controlled Digital Lending.</li>
<li>They thought broadly about access to collections, considering not only, “What helps my local community?” but also, “What helps the global community?”</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to their shared achievements, they also brought their individual strengths to their work:</p>
<p>Kanta’s persistent, steady, and polite pushes—whether about donations logistics, joining Open Libraries, or offering suggestions to expand the program—are what it takes to make things happen. Kanta’s gracious and humble nature belie her steely resolve and approach to program advancement: Kanta just kept at it, politely, until she got the results that she thought was right for her library and her community.</p>
<p>Lisa has joined discussions about Controlled Digital Lending since 2019, participating in several panel presentations for librarians and even participating in discussions with US lawmakers and policy experts alongside ALA Annual in Washington, D.C. Lisa’s professionalism and thoughtfulness helped librarians new to the practice of Controlled Digital Lending understand how their library could benefit.</p>

<p>Registration is now open for the <a href="http://libraryleadersforum.org/">Library Leaders Forum 2021</a>, our annual gathering of experts from the library, copyright, and information policy fields. Following the success of last year’s virtual Forum, which brought together hundreds of attendees from all over the world, we will again host a series of online workshops, presentations, and discussion sessions over four weeks in October. <a href="http://libraryleadersforum.org/"><strong>Register now!</strong></a></p>
<p>This year, we are focusing our discussions around the theme, “<strong>Digital Ownership &amp; the Future of Library Collections</strong>.” As more content moves digital, and as publishers refuse to sell ebooks to libraries in favor of restrictive licensing models, librarians wonder, “What will our library collections look like?” We will explore this question and related issues throughout the <a href="http://libraryleadersforum.org/">Library Leaders Forum sessions and conference workshops</a>, which include:</p>
<h2 id="library-leaders-forum">Library Leaders Forum</h2>
<p><strong>Session I: Community Dialogue</strong><br />
<em>October 13 @ 10am PT / 1pm ET</em> – <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_CTiXGiJ5R6GM_YIVJtvkBA">Register</a><br />
In our first session, hear from library leaders as they navigate the challenges of the ebook marketplace, and their concerns about the future of library collections as content moves digital. We’ll also be joined by copyright experts and publishers for a panel discussion on digital ownership.</p>
<p><strong>Session II: Community Impact</strong><br />
<em>October 20 @ 10am PT / 1pm ET</em> – <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_lkvG3xPwT_60QEpT8OcBMg">Register</a><br />
In our second session, we’ll explore the impacts that digital collections have had for libraries during the pandemic. Hear firsthand from educators &amp; librarians about the value of digitized library collections for the patrons, students, and communities they serve. We’ll also feature new developments at the Internet Archive, and how these advances help connect digital learners with books, articles, and other resources. We’ll finish the session by awarding the Internet Archive Hero Award 2021.</p>
<h2 id="conference-workshops">Conference Workshops</h2>
<p><strong>Controlled Digital Lending: Unlocking the Library’s Full Potential</strong><br />
<em>October 7 @ 10am PT / 1pm ET</em> – <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/controlled-digital-lending-unlocking-the-librarys-full-potential-tickets-173821172807">Register</a><br />
Last month, Library Futures Foundation released a new policy document, “<a href="https://www.libraryfutures.net/policy-document-2021">Controlled Digital Lending: Unlocking the Library’s Full Potential</a>.” Library Futures Foundation developed this document in consultation with the Intellectual Property and Information Policy (iPIP) Clinic at Georgetown Law. The document covers all the benefits, innovations, and goals that are the basis of any controlled digital lending system and makes the crucial connection between CDL and issues of equity. It expands beyond the legal rationale laid out in the Controlled Digital Lending (CDL) White Paper by clarifying the core principles that are the foundations of a library’s mission to provide access to materials to serve the public good.</p>
<p>This session will provide an opportunity to hear from the authors of the policy document, to engage in a virtual discussion, and to give your feedback on how this document may be useful to your community.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering Libraries Through Controlled Digital Lending</strong><br />
<em>October 12 @ 10am PT / 1pm ET</em> – <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_2xoZjoz0SKuUvO29a3X0xA">Register</a><br />
The Internet Archive’s Open Libraries program empowers libraries to lend digital books to patrons using Controlled Digital Lending. Attendees will learn how CDL works, the benefits of the Open Libraries program, and the impact that the program is having for partner libraries and the communities they serve.</p>
<p><strong>Resource Sharing with the Internet Archive</strong><br />
<em>October 27 @ 10am PT / 1pm ET</em> – <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/resource-sharing-with-the-internet-archive-tickets-173835766457">Register</a><br />
Learn about the Internet Archive’s new resource sharing initiatives and how your library can participate.</p>

<p>Back in March 2020, teachers were asking themselves a nearly unthinkable question: “How are we going to get books in students’ hands with our schools &amp; libraries closed?” We’ve heard from hundreds of teachers about the challenges they faced in connecting remote learners with books during COVID. Here is their story:</p>
<p>And here we are in August of 2021, with another school year about to start, and educators are still asking this same question. As a nonprofit dedicated to Universal Access to All Knowledge, the Internet Archive provides a number of free resources for parents, students, teachers, and librarians around the world. Check out these tools for remote learning:</p>

<p>Libraries have historically been trusted hubs to equalize access to credible information, a crucial role that they should continue to fill in the digital age. However, as more information is born-digital, digitized, or digital-first, libraries must build new policy, legal and public understandings about how advances in technology impact our preservation, community, and collection development practices.</p>
<p>This panel will bring together legal scholars Ariel Katz (University of Toronto) and Argyri Panezi (IE University Madrid/Stanford University) to discuss their work on library digital exhaustion and public service roles for digital libraries. They will be joined by Lisa Radha Weaver, Director of Collections and Program Development at Hamilton Public Library, who will discuss how library services have been transformed by digital delivery and innovation and Kyle Courtney of Library Futures/Harvard University, a lawyer/librarian who wrote the influential Statement on Controlled Digital Lending, signed by over 50 institutions. The panel will be moderated by Lila Bailey of Internet Archive.</p>

<p><em>Guest post by author Fran Moreland Johns.</em></p>
<p>Whenever I’ve had a book published I have celebrated every sale. But the biggest cause for celebration – the sale that always made me most proud – was when a library acquired a copy or two. Individuals may purchase a book, shelve it or pass it along to a friend, and thereafter it disappears. Libraries are forever.</p>

<p>This is the belief that underscores my enthusiasm for the Internet Archive. While the Atlanta Public Library may one day cull my book to make room for someone else’s, those words I labored over and so treasure, whether anyone else ever treasures them or not, are safe with the Internet Archive. And may it thrive and prosper.</p>

<p>This is all a very long way from my literary beginnings on a Royal portable typewriter. I wrote for newspapers and magazines – the <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch, USA Today, National Real Estate Investor</em> to cite just a few of the wildly different multiple dozens – from the early 1950s into the technologically bewildering 2020s. Eventually I added an MFA in short fiction to my BA in Art and veered into short stories, with a few tiny publication successes, including <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/dyingunafraid0000john">Dying unafraid</a></em> (1999) and <em>Perilous Times: An inside look at abortion before – and after – Roe v Wade</em> (2013). When the internet came along, I tiptoed in via a blog for news aggregate site True/Slant.com which eventually morphed into today’s <a href="https://franjohns.net/">franjohns.net</a>. With a little luck my short story collection, <em>Marshallville Stories</em>, will be published in 2022; the Internet Archive will get one of the first copies.</p>
<p>I’ve been following the <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/publishers-are-taking-the-internet-to-court/">conflict between U.S. publishers and the Internet Archive</a> with some degree of horror and dismay. Publishers, I realize, are in business to make money and thereby stay in business. Do they not want people, as many people as possible, to read the books they publish? After the first flurry of sales (perhaps excluding the blockbuster books that will make big bucks for authors and publishers alike, may they also thrive and prosper) does it not follow that publishers would want their books to enjoy long and successful lives? That, at least, is the hope I believe most authors harbor. I can’t claim to speak for other authors, but this I know is personally true: I write for the joy of writing, and in the hope of being read. I’d be surprised if there were many writers out there who don’t feel the same.</p>
<p>So let’s hear it for libraries. And for the one that’s unique among all others, the Internet Archive.</p>

<p>For the second event in a summer series about the innovative library practice of Controlled Digital Lending, we’ll hear from libraries, consortia, and librarians who are exploring CDL implementations at their institutions and communities with hands on learning around potential and existing solutions. Learn about building institutional CDL policies, user experience for patrons and staff, technological platforms, and how you can get involved with the CDL community. Bring your questions, ideas, and be prepared to dig in!</p>
<p>Co-hosted by Library Futures, Internet Archive, Project Reshare, Open Library Foundation, and CDL Implementers</p>

<p><em>Cross-posted from the <a href="https://blc.org/ia">Boston Library Consortium web site</a>.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://blc.org/">Boston Library Consortium</a> (BLC) has welcomed the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> as its newest affiliate member – joining 19 other libraries in the BLC’s network working on innovative solutions that enrich the creation, dissemination and preservation of knowledge.  </p>
<p>The Internet Archive, the non-profit library which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, has large physical, born-digital and digitized collections serving a global user base. The Internet Archive’s history with the BLC goes back to the formation of the Open Content Alliance, through which the member libraries committed $845,000 to begin digitizing out-of-copyright books from their collections in 2007.</p>
<p>As part of the affiliate membership, the Internet Archive will participate in many of the BLC’s programs, including the consortium’s membership communities and professional development initiatives. The BLC will also pilot an expansion of its resource sharing program, allowing faculty, students, and scholars across the membership to tap into the Internet Archive’s vast digital collection through inter-library lending of non-returnables.</p>
<p>“Resource sharing is core to the mission and purpose of the Boston Library Consortium,” said Anne Langley, president of the BLC and dean of the UConn Library. “We are enthusiastic about leveraging our shared expertise to mobilize the digital collections that the Internet Archive stewards.”</p>
<p>For Brewster Kahle, founder and digital librarian of the Internet Archive, this membership builds on a longstanding partnership with the BLC. “We love the BLC and its libraries,” said Kahle. “We’ve been working with the BLC and its member libraries as we have digitized our collections for more than ten years. Being welcomed into the consortium will enable further and closer collaboration between this forward-looking collective of libraries.”</p>
<p>Charlie Barlow, executive director of the BLC, who worked to bring the Internet Archive into the consortium, said the BLC recognizes the value of extending its reach. “The BLC is thinking about new mechanisms upon which we can share knowledge,” said Barlow. “The events of the past year only reinforced our belief that the more we can draw on digital resources, the more effectively we can serve our membership and the scholarly community.”</p>
<p><strong>About the Boston Library Consortium</strong></p>
<p>Founded in 1970, the BLC is an academic library consortium serving public and private universities, liberal arts colleges, state and special research libraries in New England. The BLC members collaborate to deliver innovative and cost-effective sharing of print and digital content, professional development initiatives, and projects across a wide range of library practice areas.</p>
<p><strong>About the Internet Archive</strong></p>
<p>The Internet Archive is one of the largest libraries in the world and home of the Wayback Machine, a repository of 475 billion web pages. Founded in 1996 by Internet Hall of Fame member Brewster Kahle, the Internet Archive now serves more than 1.5 million patrons each day, providing access to 70+ petabytes of data—books, web pages, music, television and software—and working with more than 800 library and university partners to create a digital library, accessible to all.</p>

<p>The Internet Archive has been partnering with libraries to digitize their collections for more than 15 years. Following a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/internetarchive/status/1358090982189719552">viral video</a> featuring our book digitization efforts, and increased demands for e-resources, we’ve had renewed interest in our book scanning partnerships, with libraries wondering how we might be able to help them reach their patrons through digitization. Join scanning center managers Andrea Mills and Elizabeth MacLeod for a virtual event to learn about the ways in which the Internet Archive can help turn your print collections digital, and the impacts that these digital collections are having on remote learners.</p>
<p>Registration for the virtual event is free and open to the public. The live session is being offered twice to accommodate schedules and flexibility; if you are interested in joining, you only need to register for one session:<br />
