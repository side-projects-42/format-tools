<p><a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/index.html">Community Webs</a>, the Internet Archive’s community history web and digital archiving program, is welcoming over 60 new members from across the US, Canada, and internationally. This new cohort is the first expansion of the Community Webs program outside of the United States and we are thrilled to be supporting the development of diverse, community-based web collections on an international scale. </p>
<p>Community Webs empowers cultural heritage organizations to collaborate with their communities to build web and digital archives of primary sources documenting local history and culture, especially collections inclusive of voices typically underrepresented in traditional memory collections. The program achieves this mission by providing its members with free access to the <a href="https://archive-it.org/">Archive-It</a> web archiving service, digital preservation and digitization services, and technical support and training in topics such as web archiving, community outreach, and digital preservation. The program also offers resources to support a local history archiving community of practice and to facilitate scholarly research.</p>
<p>New Community Webs member Karen Ng, Archivist at Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Úxwumixw (Squamish Nation), BC, Canada, notes that the program offers a way to capture community-generated online content in a context where many of the Nation’s records are held by other institutions. “The Squamish Nation community is active in creating and documenting language, traditional knowledge, and histories. Now more than ever in the digital age, it is imperative that these stories and histories be captured and stored in accessible ways for future generations.” </p>
<p>Similarly, for Maryna Chernyavska, Archivist at the Kule Folklore Centre in Edmonton, Canada, the program will allow the Centre to continue building relationships with community members and organizations. “Being able to assist local heritage organizations with web archiving will help us empower these communities to preserve their heritage based on their values and priorities, but also according to professional standards.”</p>
<p>The current expansion of the program was made possible in part by <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/12/08/community-webs-program-receives-1130000-andrew-w-mellon-foundation-award-for-a-national-network-of-public-libraries-building-local-history-web-archives/">generous funding from the Andrew Mellon Foundation</a>, which supports the growth of Community Webs to new public libraries in the US. Additional funding provided by the Internet Archive allows the program to reach cultural heritage organizations in Canada and beyond. This newest cohort brings the total number of participants in Community Webs to over 150 organizations, a ten-fold increase since the program’s inception in 2017. For a full list of new participants, see below. The program continues to add members – if your institution is interested in joining, please view our open <a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/about.html">calls for applications</a> and please make your favorite local memory organization aware of the opportunity.</p>
<p>Programming for the new cohort is underway and these members are already diving into the program’s educational resources and familiarizing themselves with the technical aspects of web archiving and digital preservation. We kicked things off recently with introductory Zoom sessions, where participants met one another and shared their organizations’ missions, communities served and goals for membership in the program. <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/enroll/GMD9G6">Online training modules</a>, developed by staff at the Internet Archive and the <a href="https://educopia.org/">Educopia Institute</a>, went live for new members at the beginning of September. And our new cohort joined our existing Community Webs partners at our virtual <a href="https://archive-it.org/blog/fall-2021-community-webs-virtual-partner-meeting/">Partner Meeting</a> on September 22nd. </p>
<p>We are thrilled to see the program continuing to grow and we look forward to working with our newest cohort. A warm welcome to the following new Community Webs members!</p>

<p>Much of the art gallery, artist, and arts organization materials that were once published in print form are now available primarily or solely on the web. These groups, like many in the cultural sector, have also been hit especially hard by the global pandemic, making their web presences particularly at-risk of being lost if they are not proactively collected and preserved.The creation of reference and research resources that promote streamlined access and enable new types of scholarly use will ensure that the art historical record of the 21st century, and especially of our current global pandemic, is readily accessible far into the future.</p>

<p>For this reason, the Internet Archive, along with the <a href="https://nyarc.org/">New York Art Resources Consortium</a> (NYARC), are pleased to announce our project <em>Consortial Action to Preserve Born-Digital, Web-Based Art History &amp; Culture.</em> The project recently received a two-year, $305,343 Humanities Collections and Reference Resources grant from the Division of Preservation and Access at the <a href="https://www.neh.gov/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a>. This award will support the formation of a cooperative group of 30+ art and museum libraries from across the United States to collaborate on the preservation of, and access to vital arts content from the web. </p>
<p>The Internet Archive has a long history of building and supporting collaborative communities and providing non-profit web, preservation, and access services to cultural heritage organizations. The multi-institutional initiative between Internet Archive, NYARC, and other arts and museum organizations will build on similar community-based archiving and professional cultivation projects in the Community Programs group, especially our <a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/about.html">Community Webs</a> program, <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2021/06/10/community-webs-seeks-applicants-from-the-us-canada-and-around-the-world/">currently expanding nationally and internationally</a>. Community Webs has <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/12/08/community-webs-program-receives-1130000-andrew-w-mellon-foundation-award-for-a-national-network-of-public-libraries-building-local-history-web-archives/">received funding from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and IMLS</a> to provide public libraries and cultural heritage organizations with services, training, and professional development opportunities to document their diverse local history. </p>
<p>NYARC are pioneers in collaborative web archiving and shared services, among art and museum libraries. NYARC’s robust web archive collections encompass art resources, artists’ websites, auction catalogs, catalogues raisonnes, and hundreds of New York City gallery websites. The Internet Archive and NYARC have partnered on work to build born-digital collecting capacity among arts organizations in the past, most recently in the IMLS-funded <a href="https://archive-it.org/blog/learn-more/art-libraries/">Advancing Art Libraries and Curated Web Archives</a> National forum and related events.  Through discussions, workshops and roadmapping sessions with leaders in art and museum libraries, a strategy and plan  towards an inclusive, sustainable, cooperative approach to collecting and stewarding born-digital, locally-focused art history collection was developed, forming the basis of this broader cooperative effort.</p>
<p>Members in the project’s preliminary group of art and museum libraries will select topics and specific web content that is relevant to their expertise, will provide metadata to facilitate access to archived content, and will participate in planning and evaluation meetings, all while curating a valuable reference resource that will enhance their traditional collecting areas. The Internet Archive will coordinate communications, facilitate governance and collective curatorial activities, provide technical digital library and archive services, and help enable members to build and maintain discovery and access platforms, as well as facilitate researcher use of the collections resulting from the group’s work.</p>
<p>If your art or museum library is interested in joining this collaborative effort, please fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNyceH86DmYU3Pcgz50CKWqDh_gbH0RmsrbZuz0ZOcSdyzUQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">participation form</a> by <strong>July 31</strong> to join us! </p>

<p>Internet Archive’s <a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/">Community Webs</a> program is delighted to announce a partnership with the <a href="https://dp.la/">Digital Public Library of America</a> (DPLA) to ingest metadata from the over 700 publicly available Community Webs web archive collections into DPLA. These collections include thousands of archived websites and millions of individual web-published resources that document local history and underrepresented groups. The Internet Archive has been a DPLA content provider since 2015, primarily contributing content from our many print digitizing partnerships. Community Webs will also join DPLA as a member and we are excited for this opportunity to add hyperlocal born-digital and web collections from public libraries nationwide into DPLA’s national portal to cultural heritage collections.</p>

<p>The Community Webs program was launched in 2017 to provide training, infrastructure, services, and professional community cultivation for public librarians across the country for the purpose of documenting local history and community archiving, especially documenting communities and populaces traditionally excluded from the historical record. The program is in the midst of <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/12/08/community-webs-program-receives-1130000-andrew-w-mellon-foundation-award-for-a-national-network-of-public-libraries-building-local-history-web-archives/">nationwide expansion</a> and currently includes more than 100 member public libraries who are collaborating with local organizations, movements, and groups to document the lives and accomplishments of their citizens. The program continues to add new public libraries and cultural heritage organizations to support and scale their community archiving and has an open <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2021/06/10/community-webs-seeks-applicants-from-the-us-canada-and-around-the-world/">call for applications</a> in the US, Canada, and internationally for additional public libraries and local heritage organizations to join the program. Examples of Community Webs collections include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community Webs members have created more than 30 collections documenting local responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/13651">COVID-19 Coronavirus East Baton Rouge Parish</a> from East Baton Rouge Parish Library and Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture’s “<a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/13918">Novel Coronavirus COVID-19</a>” collection which focuses on “the African diasporan experiences of COVID-19 including racial disparities in health outcomes and access, the impact on Black-owned businesses, and cultural production.” </li>
<li>Community Webs members have created a number of collections documenting LGBTQ groups, events and other resources, including <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/11971">LGBTQIA/Hormel Resources</a> from San Francisco Public Library and Birmingham Public Library’s “<a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/10415">LGBTQ in Alabama</a>” collection.</li>
<li>Members are also actively archiving materials on their local or regional culture, such as Kansas City Public Library’s <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/9945">Arts &amp; Culture</a> collection, which “documents Kansas City’s thriving arts community, including galleries, museums, nonprofits, advocacy organizations, criticism and art spaces.”</li>
<li>Many members have focused on documenting local social services or advocacy groups, such as Madison Public Library’s <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/7941">Racial Equity and Social Justice, Madison, WI</a> collection of “organizations and non-profits that engage in public discourse on issues of racial equity and social justice.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Working with a mission-aligned organization like DPLA and our shared values of collaboration, open access, and community empowerment made it an obvious fit for Community Webs member collections to also be available in DPLA. Some public libraries who are a part of the Community Webs program are also members of local or statewide DPLA content hubs, and already have digitized content available in DPLA.The partnership between DPLA and Community Webs will ensure that archived web and born-digital collections are accessible alongside similar digitized materials for seamless discovery and access for uses. Pairing Community Webs’ free archiving, infrastructure, education, and other services with DPLA’s aggregation tools, hubs networks, and its advocacy role will help expand national access and capacity for making primary sources, and a more diverse archival record, accessible to any online user,</p>
<p>“DPLA’s new partnership with the Community Webs program will help further our mission to provide free digital access to cultural heritage artifacts that inform a truly representative history of our nation, “ said Shaneé Yvette Murrain, director of community engagement for DPLA. “We are thrilled to be deepening our work with Internet Archive through a program so perfectly aligned with our organizations’ shared values.”</p>
<p>“Pairing the community web archives of 100+ public libraries and the cohort cultivation that are part of Community Webs with the national scope and professional networks native to DPLA is a perfect match. We are excited to expand access to these amazing grassroots digital collections,” said Jefferson Bailey, Director of Web Archiving &amp; Data Services at Internet Archive.</p>
<p>We are excited to be partnering with DPLA to increase access to these vital community history collections and look forward to building more integrations and furthering this collaboration in the years to come.</p>

<p>Community Webs provides infrastructure and services, training and education, and professional community cultivation for public libraries and cultural heritage organizations to document local history and the lives of their communities. <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2018/02/28/27-public-libraries-and-the-internet-archive-launch-community-webs-for-local-history-web-archiving/">Launched in the US in 2017</a> with kickoff funding from the <a href="https://www.imls.gov/">Institute of Museum and Library Services</a> (IMLS), Community Webs began <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/12/08/community-webs-program-receives-1130000-andrew-w-mellon-foundation-award-for-a-national-network-of-public-libraries-building-local-history-web-archives/">expanding nationally in 2020</a> with generous support from <a href="https://mellon.org/">The Andrew W.

<p>The program offers a unique opportunity for participating organizations to build capacity in digital collecting. Community Webs participants work alongside peer organizations and with their local communities to document the lives of their citizens, marginalized voices, and groups often absent from the historical record. All Community Webs participants receive: </p>
<ul>
<li>A guaranteed multi-year free subscription to the Archive-It web archiving service, which includes perpetual storage and access provided by the Internet Archive.</li>
<li>Access to additional Internet Archive non-profit services, such as digitization and digital preservation, either for free (as funding allows) or at or below actual cost.</li>
<li>Training and educational resources related to digital collections, web archiving, digital preservation, and other topics, as well as access to a cohort community pursuing similar work and to networking spaces, events, and knowledge sharing platforms.</li>
<li>The option to leverage program partnerships and integrations to include community web archives in other aggregators or access platforms beyond Internet Archive.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program currently includes over 100 public libraries from across the United States. These organizations have collectively archived over 70 terabytes of web-based community heritage materials. Some highlights include:</p>

<p>The benefits of the program are wide-ranging and impactful for both participants and their communities. As Community Webs member Makiba J. Foster of the African American Research Library and Cultural Center in Broward County, Florida stated during a recent Community Webs event, <a href="https://archive.org/details/archiving-the-black-diaspora"><em>Archiving the Black Diaspora</em></a>, “Community Webs provided me with the training, they provided me with the cohort support, […] provided me with services, and particularly it helped to develop an expertise for me in terms of creating collections of historically significant web materials documenting our local communities.” The program “allowed me to start a project of recovery and documentation of digitally born content related to the Black experience.” More information about what Foster and other Community Webs members are up to can be found by viewing our <a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/news.html">recent program announcements</a>.</p>

<p>The Internet Archive’s <a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/">Community Webs</a> Program provides training and education, infrastructure and services, and professional community cultivation for public librarians across the country to document their local history and the lives of their patrons. Following our <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/12/08/community-webs-program-receives-1130000-andrew-w-mellon-foundation-award-for-a-national-network-of-public-libraries-building-local-history-web-archives/">recent announcement</a> of the program’s national expansion, with support from the <a href="https://mellon.org">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>, we are excited to welcome the first class of 50+ new public libraries to the program. This brings the current number of new and returning Community Webs participants to 90+ libraries from 33 states and 3 US territories. This diverse group of organizations includes multiple state libraries representing their regions, as well as a mix of large metropolitan library systems, small libraries in rural areas, and libraries like the Feleti Barstow Public Library in American Samoa. All will be working to document their communities, with a particular focus on archiving materials from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>The new cohort class kicked off with virtual introductory events in mid-March, where participants met one another and shared stories about their communities and their goals for preserving and providing access to local history materials. Member libraries are currently receiving training in topics such as collection development and starting to build digital collections that reflect local diversity, events, and culture.</p>
<p>Program participant Kathleen Pickering, Director of the Belen Public Library and Harvey House Museum in Belen, New Mexico notes that their library “is committed to free and open-source electronic resources for our patrons, especially given the low-income status of many of our residents” and Community Webs will help further that goal. Similarly, new cohort member Aaron Ramirez of Pueblo City-County Library District (PCCLD) found Community Webs to be a great fit for existing institutional goals and initiatives. “PCCLD’s five-year strategic plan directs us to embrace local cultures, to include individuals of all skill levels and physical abilities, and to enrich established partnerships and collaborations. The groups that have not seen themselves in our archives will find through this project PCCLD’s intention and means to listen and go forward as allies and as a resource of support, rather than an institution serving only the affluent.”</p>

<p>Makiba J. Foster, Manager of The African American Research Library and Cultural Center of Broward County, Florida pointed out that “as content becomes increasingly digital, we need this opportunity to document the digital life and content of our community which includes a diverse representation of the Black Diaspora.”  Makiba was a member of the original Community Webs cohort in a previous position at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at New York Public Library, and recently <a href="https://archive.org/details/archiving-the-black-diaspora">presented</a> on her work archiving the black diaspora to a group of more than 200 attendees.</p>
<p>The Community Webs Program is continuing to grow towards the milestone of over 150 participating libraries across the United States and will soon announce another call for applicants for a U.S. cohort starting in late summer. The program also is beginning to expand internationally, starting in Canada, exploring the addition of other types of libraries and cultural heritage organizations, and expanding its suite of training and services available to participants. Expect more news on these initiatives soon. </p>
