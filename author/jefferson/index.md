<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/scholar-vaporwave-logo-300x145.png" class="wp-image-23519" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/scholar-vaporwave-logo-300x145.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/scholar-vaporwave-logo.png 467w" width="225" height="109" /></figure>

As part of our ongoing efforts to archive and provide perpetual access to at-risk, open-access scholarship, we have released Refcat (“reference” + “catalog”), the citation index culled from the catalog that underpins our [IA Scholar](https://scholar.archive.org/) service for discovering the scholarly literature and research outputs within Internet Archive. This first release of the Refcat dataset contains over 1.3 billion citations extracted from over 60 million metadata records and over 120 million scholarly artifacts (articles, books, datasets, proceedings, code, etc) that IA Scholar has archived through web harvesting, digitization, integrations with other open knowledge services, and through partnerships and joint initiatives.

Refcat represents one of the larger citation graph datasets of scholarly literature, as well as uniquely containing a notable portion of citations from works that do not have a DOI or persistent identifier. We hope this dataset will be a valuable community resource alongside other critical knowledge graph projects, including those with which we are collaborating, such as [OpenCitations](https://opencitations.net/) and [Wikicite](http://wikicite.org/). 

The Refcat dataset is released under a CC0 license and is [available for download from archive.org](https://archive.org/details/refcat_2021-07-28). The related software created for the extraction and matching process, including exact and fuzzy citation matching ([refcat](https://gitlab.com/internetarchive/refcat) and [fuzzycat](https://gitlab.com/internetarchive/fuzzycat/)), are also released as open-source tools. For those interested in technical details about the project, a white paper is [available on arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06595) authored by IA engineers, including Martin Czygan, who led work on Refcat, and is described in [our catalog user guide](https://guide.fatcat.wiki/reference_graph.html).

What does Refcat mean for regular users of IA Scholar? Refcat results from work to ensure the interconnection between material within IA Scholar and other resources archived in Internet Archive in order to make browsing and lookups easier and to ensure overall citation integrity and persistence. For example, there are over 25 million web links in the citations in Refcat and we were able to match ~14 million of these to archived web pages in [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/) and also found that ~18% of these matched web citations are no longer available on the live web. Web links in citations not in Wayback Machine have been added to ongoing web harvests. We also matched over 20 million citations to books that are available for lending in our [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/) service and matched over 1 million citations to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) entries. 

Besides interconnection, Refcat will allow users to understand what works have cited a specific scholarly resource (i.e. “cited by” or “inbound citations”) that will help with improved discovery features. Finally, knowing the full “knowledge graph” of IA Scholar helps us better identify important scholarly material that we have not yet archived, thus improving the overall quality and extent of the collection. This, in turn, aids scholars by ensuring their open-access work is archived and accessible forever, especially for those whose publisher may not have the resources for long-term preservation, and it ensures that related outputs like research registrations or datasets are also archived, matched to the article of record, and available into the future.

The Refcat release is a milestone of Phase Two of our project, “Ensuring the Persistent Access of Long Tail Open Access Journal Literature,” [first announced in 2018](http://blog.archive.org/2018/03/05/andrew-w-mellon-foundation-awards-grant-to-the-internet-archive-for-long-tail-journal-preservation/) and supported by funding from the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/grants/grants-database/grants/internet-archive/1910-07256/). Current work focuses on citation integrity within the IA Scholar archive, partnerships and services, such as our role in the multi-institutional [Project Jasper](https://doaj.org/preservation/) and our partnership with [Center for Open Science](http://blog.archive.org/2019/09/24/internet-archive-and-center-for-open-science-collaborate-to-preserve-open-science-data/), and the addition of secondary scholarly outputs to IA Scholar, including datasets, software, and other non-article/book scholarly materials. Lookout for a plethora of announcements about other IA Scholar milestones in the coming months!

In July, we announced our [partnership with the Archives Unleashed](http://blog.archive.org/2020/07/28/archive-it-and-archives-unleashed-join-forces-to-scale-research-use-of-web-archives/) project as part of our ongoing effort to make new services available for scholars and students to study the archived web. Joining the curatorial power of our [Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/) service, our work [supporting text and data mining](http://blog.archive.org/tag/web-data-research/), and [Archives Unleashed’s](https://archivesunleashed.org/) in-browser analysis tools will open up new opportunities for understanding the petabyte-scale volume of historical records in web archives.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AUAI-Announcement-1024x288.png" class="wp-image-21054" sizes="(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AUAI-Announcement-1024x288.png 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AUAI-Announcement-300x84.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AUAI-Announcement-768x216.png 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AUAI-Announcement-624x176.png 624w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AUAI-Announcement.png 1130w" width="309" height="87" /></figure>

As part of our partnership, we are releasing a series of publicly available datasets created from archived web collections. Alongside these efforts, the project is also launching a Cohort Program providing funding and technical support for research teams interested in studying web archive collections. These twin efforts aim to help build the infrastructure and services to allow more researchers to leverage web archives in their scholarly work. More details on the new public datasets and the cohorts program are below. 

**Early Web Datasets**

Our first in a series of public datasets from the web collections are oriented around the theme of the early web. These are, of course, datasets intended for data mining and researchers using computational tools to study large amounts of data, so are absent the informational or nostalgia value of looking at archived webpages in the Wayback Machine. If the latter is more your interest, here is an archived [Geocities page with unicorn GIFs](https://web.archive.org/web/20040312165034/http://www.geocities.com/linda6619/caitlinsgraphics.html).

**GeoCities Collection (1994–2009)**

As one of the first platforms for creating web pages without expertise, Geocities lowered the barrier of entry for a new generation of website creators. There were at least 38 million pages displayed by GeoCities before it was terminated by Yahoo! in 2009. This dataset collection contains a number of individual datasets that include data such as domain counts, image graph and web graph data, and binary file information for a variety of file formats like audio, video, and text and image files. A graphml file is also available for the domain graph.

GeoCities Dataset Collection: <https://archive.org/details/geocitiesdatasets>

**Friendster (2003–2015)**

Friendster was an early and widely used social media networking site where users were able to establish and maintain layers of shared connections with other users. This dataset collection contains  graph files that allow data-driven research to explore how certain pages within Friendster linked to each other. It also contains a dataset that provides some basic metadata about the individual files within the archival collection. 

Friendster Dataset Collection: <https://archive.org/details/friendsterdatasets>

**Early Web Language Datasets (1996–1999)**

These two related datasets were generated from the Internet Archive’s global web archive collection. The first dataset, “Parallel Language Records of the Early Web (1996–1999)” provides a dataset of multilingual records, or URLs of websites that have the same text represented in multiple languages. Such multi-language text from websites are a rich source for parallel language corpora and can be valuable in machine translation. The second dataset, “Language Annotations of the Early Web (1996–1999)” is another metadata set that annotates the language of over four million websites using Compact Language Detector (CLD3).

**Archives Unleashed Cohort Program**

Applications are now being accepted from research teams interested in performing computational analysis of web archive data. Five cohorts teams of up to five members each will be selected to participate in the program from July 2021 to June 2022. Teams will:

-   Participate in cohort events, training, and support, with a closing event held at Internet Archive, in San Francisco, California, USA tentatively in May 2022. Prior events will be virtual or in-person, depending on COVID-19 restrictions
-   Receive bi-monthly mentorship via support meetings with the Archives Unleashed team
-   Work in the Archive-It Research Cloud to generate custom datasets
-   Receive funding of $11,500 CAD to support project work. Additional support will be provided for travel to the Internet Archive event

Applications are due March 31, 2021. Please visit the [Archives Unleashed Research Cohorts webpage](https://archivesunleashed.org/cohorts/) for more details on the program and instructions on how to apply.

Local history collections are necessary to understanding the life and culture of a community. As methods for sharing  information have shifted towards the web, there are many more avenues for community members to document diverse experiences.  Public libraries play a critical role in building community-oriented archives and these collections  are particularly important in recording the impact of unprecedented events on the lives of local citizens. 

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/comm_webs_logo.png" class="wp-image-16072" width="300" height="152" /></figure>

Last week, [we announced](https://blog.archive.org/2020/12/08/community-webs-program-receives-1130000-andrew-w-mellon-foundation-award-for-a-national-network-of-public-libraries-building-local-history-web-archives/) a major national expansion of our [Community Webs](https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/) program providing infrastructure, services, and training to public librarians to archive local history as documented on the web… We now invite public libraries in the United States and cultural heritage organizations in U.S. territories to [apply to join](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScDWeJ1YwpWN9APcP9FbOZIsnYV7K3mNkZw7oEFvCeGHNgOhQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) the Community Webs program. Participants in the program receive free web archiving and technical services, education, professional development, and funding to build  community history web archives, especially collections documenting the lives of patrons and communities traditionally under-represented in the historical record.

If you are a public librarian interested in joining the Community Webs program please review the full [call for applications](https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/cfa.html) and the program [FAQs](https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/faqs.html). [Online applications](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScDWeJ1YwpWN9APcP9FbOZIsnYV7K3mNkZw7oEFvCeGHNgOhQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) are being accepted through **Sunday, January 31, 2021**.

The program is seeking public libraries to join a diverse network of 150+ organizations  that are:

-   Documenting local history by saving web-published sites, stories and community engagement on the web.
-   Growing their professional skills and increasing institutional technical capacity by engaging in a supportive network of peer organizations pursuing this work.
-   Building a public understanding of web archiving as a practice and its importance to preserving 21st century community history and underrepresented voices.

[Current Community Webs cohort members](https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/participants.html) have created nearly 300 publicly available local history web archive collections on topics ranging from [COVID-19](https://archive-it.org/collections/13918), to local [arts and culture](https://archive-it.org/collections/9945), to [2020 local and U.S. elections](https://archive-it.org/collections/13134). Collecting the web-published materials of local organizations, movements and individuals is often the primary way to document their presence for future historians.

More than ever, the lives of communities are documented online. The web remains a vital resource for traditionally under-represented groups to write and share about their lives and experiences. Preserving this web-published material, in turn, allows libraries to build more expansive, inclusive, and community-oriented archival collections.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/comm_webs_logo.png" class="wp-image-16072" width="225" height="114" /></figure>

In 2017, the Internet Archive’s Archive-It service launched the program, “[Community Webs: Empowering Public Libraries to Create Community History Web Archives](http://blog.archive.org/2018/02/28/27-public-libraries-and-the-internet-archive-launch-community-webs-for-local-history-web-archiving/).” The program provides training, professional development, cohort building, and technical services for public librarians to curate community archives of websites, social media, and online material documenting the experiences of their patrons, especially those often underrepresented in traditional physical archives. Since its launch, the program has grown to include [40 public libraries in 21 states](https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/participants.html) that have built almost 300 collections documenting local civic life, especially of marginalized groups, creating an archive totaling over 50 terabytes and tens of millions of individual digital documents, images, audio-video, and more. The program received [additional funding in 2019](http://blog.archive.org/2020/03/10/community-webs-receives-additional-funding-to-further-public-library-local-history-web-collecting/) to continue its work and focus on strategic planning, partnering with the [Educopia Institute](https://educopia.org) to ensure the growth and sustainability of the program and the cohort.

We are excited to announce that Community Webs has received $1,130,000 in funding from [The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/programs/public-knowledge/) for “Community Webs: A National Network of Public Library Web Archives Documenting Local History & Underrepresented Groups,” an nationwide expansion of the program to include a minimum of 2 public libraries in each of the 50 United States, plus additional local history organizations in U.S territories, for a total of 150-200 participating public libraries and heritage organizations. Participants will receive web archiving and access services, training and education, and funds to promote and pursue their community archiving. The Community Webs National Network will also make the resulting public library local history community web archives available to scholars through specialized access tools and datasets, partner with affiliated national discovery and digital collections platforms such as [DPLA](https://dp.la), and build partnerships and collaborations with state and regional groups advancing local history digital preservation efforts. We thank The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for their generous support to grow this program nationwide and empower hundreds of public librarians to build archives that elevate the voices, lives, and events of their underrepresented communities and ensure this material is permanently available to patrons, students, scholars, and citizens.

Over the course of the Community Webs program, participating public libraries have created diverse collections on a wide range of topics, often in collaboration with members of their local communities. Examples include:

-   Community Webs members have created collections related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture’s “[Novel Coronavirus COVID-19](https://archive-it.org/collections/13918)” collection which focuses on “the African diasporan experiences of COVID-19 including racial disparities in health outcomes and access, the impact on Black-owned businesses, and cultural production.” Athens Regional Library System created a collection of “[Athens, Georgia Area COVID-19 Response](https://archive-it.org/collections/13711)” which focuses on the social, economic and health impacts of COVID-19 on the local community, with specific attention on community efforts to support frontline workers. A recent [American Libraries article](http://web.archive.org/web/20201102185901/https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/2020/11/02/collecting-coronavirus-stories/) featured the COVID archiving work of public libraries.
-   Columbus Metropolitan Library’s archive of “[Immigrant Experience](https://archive-it.org/collections/9697)”, a collection of websites on the activities, needs, and culture of immigrant communities in Central Ohio.
-   Sonoma County Public Library’s “[North Bay Fires, 2017](https://archive-it.org/collections/9742)” collection documenting when “devastating firestorms swept through Sonoma, Napa, and Mendocino Counties” and part of their “[Sonoma Responds: Community Memory Archive](https://sonomalibrary.org/sonoma-responds-community-archive).”
-   Birmingham Public Library’s “[LGBTQ in Alabama](https://archive-it.org/collections/10415)” collection “documenting the history and experiences of the LGBTQ community in Alabama.”

*Since 2017, Internet Archive has pursued dedicated technical and partnership work to help preserve and provide perpetual access to open access scholarly literature and other outputs. See our [original announcement](http://blog.archive.org/2018/03/05/andrew-w-mellon-foundation-awards-grant-to-the-internet-archive-for-long-tail-journal-preservation/) related to this work and a recent [update on progress](http://blog.archive.org/2020/09/15/how-the-internet-archive-is-ensuring-permanent-access-to-open-access-journal-articles/). The below official press release announces an exciting new multi-institutional collaboration in this area.*

The Directory of Open Access Journals ([DOAJ](https://doaj.org)), the [CLOCKSS Archive](https://clockss.org/), [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), [Keepers Registry](https://keepers.issn.org/)/ISSN International Centre and [Public Knowledge Project](https://pkp.sfu.ca/) (PKP) have agreed to partner to provide an alternative pathway for the preservation of small-scale, APC-free, Open Access journals.

[The recent study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11933) authored by M.Laakso, L.Matthias, and N.Jahn has revived academia’s concern over the disappearance of the scholarly record disseminated in Open Access (OA) journals.

Their research focuses on OA journals as at risk of vanishing, and “especially small-scale and APC-free journals \[…\] with limited financial resources” that often “opt for lightweight technical solutions” and “cannot afford to enroll in preservation schemes.” The authors have used data available in the Directory of Open Access Journals to come up with the conclusion that just under half of the journals indexed in DOAJ participate in preservation schemes. Their findings “suggest that current approaches to digital preservation are successful in archiving content from larger journals and established publishing houses but leave behind those that are more at risk.” They call for new preservation initiatives “to develop alternative pathways \[…\] better suited for smaller journals that operate without the support of large, professional publishers.”

Answering that call, the joint initiative proposed by the five organisations aims at offering an affordable archiving option to OA journals with no author fees (“diamond” OA) registered with DOAJ, as well as raising awareness among the editors and publishers of these journals about the importance of enrolling with a preservation solution. DOAJ will act as a single interface with CLOCKSS, PKP and Internet Archive and facilitate a connection to these services for interested journals. Lars Bjørnhauge, DOAJ Managing Editor, said: “That this group of organisations are coming together to find a solution to the problem of “vanishing” journals is exciting. It comes as no surprise that journals with little to no funding are prone to disappearing. I am confident that we can make a real difference here.”

Reports regarding the effective preservation of the journals’ content will be aggregated by the ISSN International Centre (ISSN IC) and published in the Keepers Registry. Gaëlle Béquet, ISSN IC Director, commented: “As the operator of the Keepers Registry service, the ISSN International Centre receives inquiries from journal publishers looking for archiving solutions. This project is a new step in the development of our service to meet this need in a transparent and diverse way involving all our partners.”

About 50% of the journals identified by DOAJ as having no archiving solution in place use the Open Journal System (OJS). Therefore, the initiative will also identify and encourage journals on PKP’s OJS platform to preserve their content in the PKP Preservation Network (PKP PN), or to use another supported solution if the OJS instance isn’t new enough to be compatible with the PN integration (OJS 3.1.2+). 

The partners will then follow up by assessing the success and viability of the initiative with an aim to open it up to new archiving agencies and other groups of journals indexed in DOAJ to consolidate preservation actions and ensure service diversity.

DOAJ will act as the central hub where publishers will indicate that they want to participate. Archiving services, provided by CLOCKSS, Internet Archive and PKP will expand their existing capacities. These agencies will report their metadata to the Keepers Registry to provide an overview of the archiving efforts. 

Project partners are currently exploring business and financial sustainability models and outlining areas for technical collaboration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DOAJ](https://doaj.org/) is a community-curated list of peer-reviewed, open access journals and aims to be the starting point for all information searches for quality, peer reviewed open access material. DOAJ’s mission is to increase the visibility, accessibility, reputation, usage and impact of quality, peer-reviewed, open access scholarly research journals globally, regardless of discipline, geography or language. DOAJ will work with editors, publishers and journal owners to help them understand the value of best practice publishing and standards and apply those to their own operations. DOAJ is committed to being 100% independent and maintaining all of its services and metadata as free to use or reuse for everyone.

CLOCKSS is a not-for-profit joint venture among the world’s leading academic publishers and research libraries whose mission is to build a sustainable, international, and geographically distributed dark archive with which to ensure the long-term survival of Web-based scholarly publications for the benefit of the greater global research community. <https://www.clockss.org>.

Internet Archive is a non-profit digital library, top 200 website at <https://archive.org/>, and archive of over 60PB of millions of free books, movies, software, music, websites, and more. The Internet Archive partners with over 800 libraries, universities, governments, non-profits, scholarly communications, and open knowledge organizations around the world to advance the shared goal of “Universal Access to All Knowledge.” Since 2017, Internet Archive has pursued partnerships and technical work with a focus on preserving all publicly accessible research outputs, especially at-risk, open access journal literature and data, and providing mission-aligned, non-commercial open infrastructure for the preservation of scholarly knowledge.

[Keepers Registry](https://keepers.issn.org/) hosted by the ISSN International Centre, an intergovernmental organisation under the auspices of UNESCO, is a global service that monitors the archiving arrangements for continuing resources including e-serials. A dozen archiving agencies all around the world currently report to Keepers Registry. The Registry has three main purposes: 1/ to enable librarians, publishers and policy makers to find out who is looking after what e-content, how, and with what terms of access; 2/ to highlight e-journals which are still “at risk of loss” and need to be archived; 3/ to showcase the archiving organizations around the world, i.e. the Keepers, which provide the digital shelves for access to content over the long term.

[PKP](https://pkp.sfu.ca/) is a multi-university and long-standing research project that develops (free) open source software to improve the quality and reach of scholarly publishing. For more than twenty years, PKP has played an important role in championing open access. Open Journal Systems (OJS) was released in 2002 to help reduce cost as a barrier to creating and consuming scholarship online. Today, it is the world’s most widely used open source platform for journal publishing: approximately 42% of the journals in the DOAJ identify OJS as their platform/host/aggregator. In 2014, PKP launched its own Private LOCKSS Network (now the PKP PN) to offer OJS journals unable to invest in digital preservation a free, open, and trustworthy service.

Archived web data and collections are increasingly important to scholarly practice, especially to those scholars interested in data mining and computational approaches to analyzing large sets of data, text, and records from the web. For over a decade Internet Archive has worked to support computational use of its web collections through a variety of services, from making [raw crawl data available](http://blog.archive.org/2012/10/26/80-terabytes-of-archived-web-crawl-data-available-for-research/) to researchers, performing customized [extraction and analytic services supporting network or language analysis](http://blog.archive.org/tag/web-data-research/), to [hosting](http://blog.archive.org/2017/01/02/join-us-for-a-white-house-social-media-and-gov-data-hackathon/) web data [hackathons](http://blog.archive.org/2016/08/31/hacking-web-archives/) and having [dataset download features](https://support.archive-it.org/hc/en-us/articles/209671666-Introduction-to-Archive-It-Research-Services-ARS-) in our popular suite of web archiving services in [Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/). Since 2016, we have also collaborated with the [Archives Unleashed](https://archivesunleashed.org/) project to support their efforts to build tools, platforms, and learning materials for social science and humanities scholars to study web collections, including those curated by the [700+ institutions using Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/explore?show=Organizations).

We are excited to announce a significant expansion of our partnership. With a generous award of $800,000 (USD) to the University of Waterloo from The [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/), Archives Unleashed and Archive-It will broaden our collaboration and further integrate our services to provide easy-to-use, scalable tools to scholars, researchers, librarians, and archivists studying and stewarding web archives.  Further integration of Archives Unleashed and Archive-It’s Research Services (and IA’s Web & Data Services more broadly) will simplify the ability of scholars to analyze archived web data and give digital archivists and librarians expanded tools for making their collections available as data, as pre-packaged datasets, and as archives that can be analyzed computationally. It will also offer researchers a best-of-class, end-to-end service for collecting, preserving, and analyzing web-published materials.

The Archives Unleashed team brings together a team of co-investigators.  Professor Ian Milligan, from the University of Waterloo’s Department of History, Jimmy Lin, Professor and Cheriton Chair at Waterloo’s Cheriton School of Computer Science, and Nick Ruest, Digital Assets Librarian in the Digital Scholarship Infrastructure department of York University Libraries, along with Jefferson Bailey, Director of Web Archiving & Data Services at the Internet Archive, will all serve as co-Principal Investigators on the “Integrating Archives Unleashed Cloud with Archive-It” project. This project represents a follow-on to the Archives Unleashed project that began in 2017, also [funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/news/multidisciplinary-project-will-help-historians-unlock).

“Our first stage of the Archives Unleashed Project,” explains Professor Milligan, “built a stand-alone service that turns web archive data into a format that scholars could easily use. We developed several tools, methods and cloud-based platforms that allow researchers to download a large web archive from which they can analyze all sorts of information, from text and network data to statistical information. The next logical step is to integrate our service with the Internet Archive, which will allow a scholar to run the full cycle of collecting and analyzing web archival content through one portal.”

“Researchers, from both the sciences and the humanities, are finally starting to realize the massive trove of archived web materials that can support a wide variety of computational research,” said Bailey. “We are excited to scale up our collaboration with Archives Unleashed to make the petabytes of web and data archives collected by Archive-It partners and other web archiving institutions around the world more useful for scholarly analysis.” 

The project begins in July 2020 and will begin releasing public datasets as part of the integration later in the year. Upcoming and future work includes technical integration of Archives Unleashed and Archive-It, creation and release of new open-source tools, datasets, and code notebooks, and a series of in-person “datathons” supporting a cohort of scholars using archived web data and collections in their data-driven research and analysis. We are grateful to The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for their support of this integration and collaboration in support of critical infrastructure supporting computational scholarship and its use of the archived web.

In 2017, our [Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/) service was awarded funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) for the 2-year project “[Community Webs: Empowering Public Librarians to Create Community History Web Archives](https://blog.archive.org/2017/07/18/imls-grant-to-advance-web-archiving-in-public-libraries/).” The program has been providing training and technical infrastructure for a diverse group of librarians nationwide to develop expertise in creating collections of historically valuable web-published materials documenting their local communities and under-represented communities. In response to an unexpectedly large group of applicants, and with additional internal funding, we were able to expand the cohort to a total of 28 libraries from 16 states. The [launch announcement](https://blog.archive.org/2018/02/28/27-public-libraries-and-the-internet-archive-launch-community-webs-for-local-history-web-archiving/) and the [dedicated website](https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/) have further information about the program and its progress.

We are excited to announce that IMLS has recently provided additional supplementary funding to Community Webs! The additional funding will allow us to focus on program evaluation, expansion, and strategic planning. We are very pleased to be working with the [Educopia Institute](https://educopia.org/) in support of this work and will benefit from their vast expertise in community cultivation and program facilitation.

Over the course of the original 2-year Community Webs program, the 28 participating libraries created hundreds of archived collections totaling more than 40 terabytes of data, gave dozens of professional presentations at local and national conferences, held many public programs and patron-facing events, and attended numerous meet-ups and cohort events. As well, the program created a suite of open educational resources, online courses, and other training materials supporting digital curation skills development, local history web collecting, and community formation. Some sample collections created as part of the program include:

[\#HashtagSyllabusMovement](https://archive-it.org/collections/9674) by [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture](https://archive-it.org/home/schomburgcenter)  
[LGBTQ in Alabama](https://archive-it.org/collections/10415) by [Birmingham Public Library](https://archive-it.org/home/birmingham)

The IIPC Content Development Group consists of curators and professionals from dozens of libraries and archives from around the world that are preserving and providing access to the archived web. The Internet Archive is a co-founder and longtime member of the IIPC. The project will include both subject-expert curation by IIPC members as well as the inclusion of websites nominated by the public (see the nomination form link below).

Due to the urgency of the outbreak, archiving of nominated web content will commence immediately and continue as needed depending on the course of the outbreak and its containment. Web content from all countries and in any language is in scope. Possible topics to guide nominations and collections: 

-   Coronavirus origins 
-   Information about the spread of infection 
-   Regional or local containment efforts
-   Medical/Scientific aspects
-   Social aspects
-   Economic aspects
-   Political aspects

Members of the general public are welcomed to nominate websites and web-published materials using the following web form: <https://forms.gle/iAdvSyh6hyvv1wvx9>. Archived information will also be available soon via the IIPC’s [public collections in Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/home/IIPC). \[March 23, 2020 edit: the public collection can now be found here, <https://archive-it.org/collections/13529>.\]

Members of the general public can also take advantage of the ability to upload non-web digital resources directly to specific Internet Archive collections such as [Community Video](https://archive.org/details/opensource_movies) or [Community Texts](https://archive.org/details/opensource). For instance, see this collection of “[Files pertaining to the 2019–20 Wuhan, China Coronavirus outbreak](https://archive.org/details/2019-nCoV).” We recommend using a common subject tag, like `coronavirus` to facilitate search and discovery. Fore more information on uploading materials to [archive.org](https://archive.org/index.php), see the [Internet Archive Help Center](https://help.archive.org/).

A special thanks to Alex Thurman of Columbia University and Nicola Bingham of the British Library, the co-chairs of the IIPC CDG, and to other IIPC members participating in the project. Thanks as well to any and all public nominators assisting with identifying and archiving records about this significant global event.

Seven crawls were run on single days from July through September and captured over 2.2TB of unique data and 16 million URLs. Initial findings from the research </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">detail how local communities cover core topics such as emergencies, politics and transportation</span>](https://dewitt.sanford.duke.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Assessing-Local-Journalism_100-Communities.pdf)<span style="font-weight: 400">.

In order to generate a random and unbiased sample of communities, the team used US Census data. Prior research suggested that average income in a community is correlated with the amount of local news coverage; thus the team decided to focus on three different income brackets (high, medium and low) using the Census data to break up the communities into categories. Rural areas and major cities were eliminated from the sample in order to reduce the number of outliers; this left a list of 1,559 communities ranging in population from 20,000 to 300,000 and in average household income from $21,000 to $215,000. Next, a random sample of 100 communities was selected, and a rigorous search process was applied to build a list of 663 news outlets that cover local news in those communities (based on Web searches and established directories such as Cision).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The News Measures Research Project web captures provide a unique snapshot of local news in the United States. The work is focused on analyzing the nature of local news coverage at a local level, while also examining the broader nature of local community news. At the local level, the 100 community sample provides a way to look at the nature of local news coverage. Next, a team of coders analyzed content on the archived web pages to assess what is being covered by a given news outlet. Often, the websites that serve a local community are simply aggregating content from other outlets, rather than providing unique content. The research team was most interested in understanding the degree to which local news outlets are actually reporting on topics that are pertinent to a given community (e.g. local politics). At the global level, the team looked at interaction between community news websites (e.g. sharing of content) as well as automated measures of the amount of coverage.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The primary data for the researchers was the archived local community news data, but in addition, the team worked with census data to aggregate other measures such as circulation data for newspapers. These data allowed the team to examine the amount and type of local news changes depending on the characteristics of the community. Because the team was using multiple datasets, the Web data is just one part of the puzzle. The</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400">WAT data format</span>](https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/ARS/WAT+Overview+and+Technical+Details)<span style="font-weight: 400"> proved particularly useful for the team in this regard. Using the WAT file format allowed the team to avoid digging deeply into the data – rather, the WAT data allowed the team to examine high level structure without needing to examine the content of each and every WARC record. Down the road, the WARC data allows for a deeper dive,  but the lighter metadata format of the WAT files has enabled early analysis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Stay tuned for more updates as research utilizing this data continues! The websites selected will continue to be archived and </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">much of the data are publicly available.</span>](https://archive.org/details/NMRP_Datasets)

[The Whole Earth Web Archive](https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/30/the-whole-earth-web-archive/)
===============================================================================================

Posted on [October 30, 2019](https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/30/the-whole-earth-web-archive/ "5:51 pm")<span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/jefferson/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by jefferson">jefferson</a></span></span>

As part of the many releases and announcements for our [October Annual Event](https://archive.org/details/world-night-market-2019), we created [The Whole Earth Web Archive](https://webservices.archive.org/wewa). The Whole Earth Web Archive (WEWA) is a proof-of-concept to explore ways to improve access to the archived websites of underrepresented nations around the world. Starting with a sample set of 50 small nations we extracted their archived web content from the Internet Archive’s web archive, built special search and access features on top of this subcollection, and created a dedicated discovery portal for searching and browsing. Further work will focus on improving IA’s harvesting of the national webs of these and other underrepresented countries as well as expanding collaborations with libraries and heritage organizations within these countries, and via international organizations, to contribute technical capacity to local experts who can identify websites of value that document the lives and activities of their citizens.

However, the web’s scale is vast, it changes and disappears quickly, and it requires significant infrastructure and expertise to collect and make permanently accessible. Thus, the community of National Libraries and Governments preserving the web remains [overwhelmingly represented by well-resourced institutions from Europe and North America](https://web.archive.org/web/20191023192755/http://web.archive.org/screenshot/http://netpreserve.org/about-us/members/). We hope the WEWA project helps provide enhanced access to archived material otherwise hard to find and browse in the massive 20+ petabytes of the Wayback Machine. More importantly, we hope the project provokes a broader reflection upon the lack of national diversity in institutions collecting the web and also spurs collective action towards diminishing the overrepresentation of “first world” nations and peoples in the overall global web archive.

As with prior special projects by the Web Archiving & Data Services team, such as [GifCities](https://gifcities.org/) (search engine for animated Gifs from the Geocities web collection) or [Military Industrial Powerpoint Complex](https://archive.org/details/MilitaryIndustrialPowerpointComplex) (ebooks of Powerpoints from the archive of the .mil (military) web domain), the project builds on our exploratory work to provide improved access to valuable subsets of the web archive. While our [Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/) service gives curators the tools to build special collections of the web, we also work to build unique collections from the pre-existing global web archive.

The preliminary set of countries in WEWA were determined by selecting the 50 “smallest” countries as measured by number of websites registered on their national web domain (aka [ccTLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain)) — a somewhat arbitrary measurement, we acknowledge. The underlying search index is based on internally-developed tools for search of both text and media. Indices are built from features like page titles or descriptive hyperlinks from other pages, with relevance ranking boosted by criteria such as number of inbound links and popularity and include a temporal dimension to account for the historicity of web archives. Additional technical information on search engineering can be found in “[Exploring Web Archives Through Temporal Anchor Texts](https://fatcat.wiki/release/bmartqgoxjgsrhvgofpbhtcr2e).”

We intend both to do more targeted, high-quality archiving of these and other smaller national webs and also have undertaking active outreach to national and heritage institutions in these nations, and to related international organizations, to ensure this work is guided by broader community input. If you are interested in contributing to this effort or have any questions, feel free to email us at webservices \[at\] archive \[dot\] org. Thanks for browsing the WEWA!
