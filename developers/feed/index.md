I previously did this by editing the select field values in developer mode. btw: Great work everyone, the site seems much smoother and no-longer crashes or freezes in IE11 on pages with a very large number of results so far. - Thanks &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With recent changes to archive.org web site history display eg:&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/\*/example.org/\*" rel="nofollow ugc"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/\*/example.org/\*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; can the select box to choose the number of results per page be&lt;br /&gt; returned and if possible, also allow for a custom value up to&lt;br /&gt; the total number of results please, which often comes in handy.&lt;br /&gt; I previously did this by editing the select field values in developer mode.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;btw: Great work everyone, the site seems much smoother and no-longer crashes or freezes in IE11 on pages with a very large number of results so far. &\#8211; Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

The posting of this private information has caused employment issue for me and I wish to have this document removed from your system. In addition I wish to know how such a document could possible be posted to an American System when the subjects involved are Canadians. The web address is below where this document is located. https://archive.org/stream/boi94\_018/boi94\_018\_djvu.txt I have searched your site to determine the proper process to have this document removed but I have been unsuccessful. I would be therefore be grateful for additional information regarding this before I expand further with the Ontario Human Rights Tribunial as to how this document was released and then ended up on your server. &lt;p&gt;Can you explain to me how an Ontario, Canada document on a human rights trail which is not public can be posted onto this site?
