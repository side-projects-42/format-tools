    thanks for pulling these posts together in a single page!

    this one link can replace 7 or 8 that i’ve squirreled away and then have to retrieve when helping someone get up to speed on the magic that happens “behind the curtain” at the Archive.

    The archive.org free wifi backbone seems to be broken, from about last Thursday. No response from headquarters.

        If an item has DjVu files you can find them by clicking the “SHOW ALL” link in the “DOWNLOAD OPTIONS” area

            Mine was a rhetorical question!  
            First, all the texts had also DJVU format, now no!

    This is a great resource for teaching. Thank you for assembling this media. Unfortunately after trying to download a Newsreel Clip the media does not appear in my download file. Not sure why this is occurring.

    Can you explain to me how an Ontario, Canada document on a human rights trail which is not public can be posted onto this site? The posting of this private information has caused employment issue for me and I wish to have this document removed from your system. In addition I wish to know how such a document could possible be posted to an American System when the subjects involved are Canadians. The web address is below where this document is located. <https://archive.org/stream/boi94_018/boi94_018_djvu.txt>

    I have searched your site to determine the proper process to have this document removed but I have been unsuccessful. I would be therefore be grateful for additional information regarding this before I expand further with the Ontario Human Rights Tribunial as to how this document was released and then ended up on your server.

    Absolutely Dorina. Vigilance should be our watch word in the digital age. Imagine 24.5million online fraud last year alone, which is frightening. We should not be caught up at all. Many thanks for visiting our site.s All the best to you always.

    Hi,

    With recent changes to archive.org web site history display eg:  
      <https://web.archive.org/web/*/example.org/*>  
    can the select box to choose the number of results per page be  
    returned and if possible, also allow for a custom value up to  
    the total number of results please, which often comes in handy.  
    I previously did this by editing the select field values in developer mode.

    btw: Great work everyone, the site seems much smoother and no-longer crashes or freezes in IE11 on pages with a very large number of results so far. – Thanks
