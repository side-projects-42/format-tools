Following the success of last year’s virtual Forum, which brought together hundreds of attendees from all over the world, we will again host a series of online workshops, presentations, and discussion sessions over four weeks in October. [**Register now!**](http://libraryleadersforum.org/)

This year, we are focusing our discussions around the theme, “**Digital Ownership & the Future of Library Collections**.” As more content moves digital, and as publishers refuse to sell ebooks to libraries in favor of restrictive licensing models, librarians wonder, “What will our library collections look like?” We will explore this question and related issues throughout the [Library Leaders Forum sessions and conference workshops](http://libraryleadersforum.org/), which include:

Library Leaders Forum
---------------------

**Session I: Community Dialogue**  
*October 13 @ 10am PT / 1pm ET* – [Register](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_CTiXGiJ5R6GM_YIVJtvkBA)  
In our first session, hear from library leaders as they navigate the challenges of the ebook marketplace, and their concerns about the future of library collections as content moves digital. We’ll also be joined by copyright experts and publishers for a panel discussion on digital ownership.

**Session II: Community Impact**  
*October 20 @ 10am PT / 1pm ET* – [Register](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_lkvG3xPwT_60QEpT8OcBMg)  
In our second session, we’ll explore the impacts that digital collections have had for libraries during the pandemic. Hear firsthand from educators & librarians about the value of digitized library collections for the patrons, students, and communities they serve. We’ll also feature new developments at the Internet Archive, and how these advances help connect digital learners with books, articles, and other resources. We’ll finish the session by awarding the Internet Archive Hero Award 2021.

Conference Workshops
--------------------

**Controlled Digital Lending: Unlocking the Library’s Full Potential**  
*October 7 @ 10am PT / 1pm ET* – [Register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/controlled-digital-lending-unlocking-the-librarys-full-potential-tickets-173821172807)  
Last month, Library Futures Foundation released a new policy document, “[Controlled Digital Lending: Unlocking the Library’s Full Potential](https://www.libraryfutures.net/policy-document-2021).” Library Futures Foundation developed this document in consultation with the Intellectual Property and Information Policy (iPIP) Clinic at Georgetown Law. The document covers all the benefits, innovations, and goals that are the basis of any controlled digital lending system and makes the crucial connection between CDL and issues of equity. It expands beyond the legal rationale laid out in the Controlled Digital Lending (CDL) White Paper by clarifying the core principles that are the foundations of a library’s mission to provide access to materials to serve the public good.

This session will provide an opportunity to hear from the authors of the policy document, to engage in a virtual discussion, and to give your feedback on how this document may be useful to your community.

**Empowering Libraries Through Controlled Digital Lending**  
*October 12 @ 10am PT / 1pm ET* – [Register](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_2xoZjoz0SKuUvO29a3X0xA)  
The Internet Archive’s Open Libraries program empowers libraries to lend digital books to patrons using Controlled Digital Lending. Attendees will learn how CDL works, the benefits of the Open Libraries program, and the impact that the program is having for partner libraries and the communities they serve.

**Resource Sharing with the Internet Archive**  
*October 27 @ 10am PT / 1pm ET* – [Register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/resource-sharing-with-the-internet-archive-tickets-173835766457)  
Learn about the Internet Archive’s new resource sharing initiatives and how your library can participate.
