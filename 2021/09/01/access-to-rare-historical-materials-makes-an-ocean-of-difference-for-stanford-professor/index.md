Access to Rare Historical Materials Makes an Ocean of Difference for Stanford Professor
=======================================================================================

Posted on [September 1, 2021](https://blog.archive.org/2021/09/01/access-to-rare-historical-materials-makes-an-ocean-of-difference-for-stanford-professor/ "12:00 pm")<span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/caraleeadams/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by Caralee Adams">Caralee Adams</a></span></span>

The kind of materials that Stanford English professor Margaret Cohen uses in her work, including the history of ocean travel in the period known as the “Age of Sail,” can be difficult to find.

Hammond Professor of French Language, Literature, and Civilization and Director, Center for the Study of the Novel at Stanford University.</figcaption></figure>Books and illustrations from the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries needed in her research and teaching are often tucked away in rare book collections. For about five years, Cohen has been turning to the Internet Archive for help. And that access was even more critical during the pandemic when physical libraries were closed.

“It’s really enriched the arguments I can make about cultural history,” Cohen said. “The availability of documents and the very intensive work of tracking these down has become so much easier. The Internet Archive is a very user-friendly tool.”

The [Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://archive.org/details/biodiversity) has been a resource to Cohen in teaching her English class, Imagining the Ocean. She has discovered [manuals from Philip Henry Gosse](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Philip+Henry+Gosse%22), who created the first public aquarium, envisioning them as beautiful ocean gardens.  Cohen also shares her screen with students to discuss drawings of the sails, seashore and [sea-anemones](https://archive.org/details/actinologiabrita00goss/page/n9/mode/2up) from the Victorian Age that she accesses through the Archive.

I’m a literature professor, but the imagination spans across different areas,” said Cohen, the Andrew B. Hammond Professor of French Language, Literature, and Civilization and Director, Center for the Study of the Novel.

In her own research of oceanic studies, Cohen explores the importance of diversity and reality in marine environments. She tapped into the Internet Archive to fact-check information for *[A Cultural History of the Sea](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/cultural-history-of-the-sea-9781474299107)*, (Bloomsbury, April 2021), a six-volume series that she edited chronicling the vital role oceans have played over time.

In researching her upcoming book, *The Underwater Eye: How the Movie Camera Opened the Depths and Unleashed New Realms of Fantasy* to be published by Princeton University Press, Cohen said the Wayback Machine was critical in confirming sources on websites that were no longer live.

Much of the material Cohen is looking for is in the public domain (such as [*Punch*](https://archive.org/details/pub_punch), a satirical British magazine that dates back to the mid-1800s ) but the documents are fragile because of their age. She has also  appreciated being able to borrow classic books of literary criticism, such as the collection on novel studies that supports her graduate course, Genres of the Novel. 

 “People’s time is limited and having access to this material facilitates scholarship,” Cohen said of the benefits of digitized documents. “I understand why publishers need to make money and I publish myself, but free access to information, particularly for nonprofit use, is a gift.”
