I noticed you have a free download of a book entitled, &quot;History of Siskiyou County&quot; by Wells. The Hsitorical Society is under the impression (although a little more research needs to be done) that we hold the current copyright on that book. If that proves to be the case we would request that you remove the title from your free downloads. If you have any documents that show permission was given to allow you to include that book in your array of titles, we would like to see it.

Cutting shows down into One minute segments renders them useless for viewing online and you ought to know it. There is no way you can say that this is truly a service to anyone. Charging people $25 to view an entire episode is doubly shameful. Not everyone has the money to pay this, and not everyone has the time. I think cutting the shows into such small and useless segments is an underhanded way to extract money from people who simply want something useful. And if they can&\#039;t afford it, they can &quot; just eat cake.&quot; Put the full episodes up in the TV News Archive, and do a real public service instead of making it truly useful only to people with money. &lt;p&gt;You should be ashamed of yourselves.

You can still use the classic site (hopefully forever, but who knows). Under the mediatypes, you should see a link called Services/Exit\_Beta or something similar. I totally agree with you about the new interface. It seems much more cluttered to me than the classic site. All the new images and item choices on a details page eat up precious bandwidth, so I&\#039;ll be using the classic version as long as possible. &lt;p&gt;In reply to &lt;a href="https://blog.archive.org/about/\#comment-350199"&gt;I&\#8217;m mad as hell and I&\#8217;m not going to take it anymore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can still use the classic site (hopefully forever, but who knows).

I am so goddam tired of peurile programmers designing websites when they have no clue as to how users work and what they need. I used to be able to search for texts; apparently I can no longer do that. I have to first search for all sorts of crap, then filter down to what I really need. Although the advanced search allows one to specify a search in texts, it&\#039;s slower than molasses. What a waste of time. As this site has no respect for its users and their time, I have no respect for this site. Buh-bye. &lt;p&gt;What a PAIN IN THE ASS your new website design is.

I wanted to ask for your advise as I am looking for webpages from European websites but all I can get from my searches in archive.org are images from the US websites. Any advise about how to use archu=ive.org to extract snapshots from European websites? do you know about any other web resource enabling me to do that? thank you in advance for helping out adele &lt;p&gt;hello everyone, this is a fantastic tool for my work!
