<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to archive and provide perpetual access to at-risk, open-access scholarship, we have released Refcat (“reference” + “catalog”), the citation index culled from the catalog that underpins our <a href="https://scholar.archive.org/">IA Scholar</a> service for discovering the scholarly literature and research outputs within Internet Archive. This first release of the Refcat dataset contains over 1.3 billion citations extracted from over 60 million metadata records and over 120 million scholarly artifacts (articles, books, datasets, proceedings, code, etc) that IA Scholar has archived through web harvesting, digitization, integrations with other open knowledge services, and through partnerships and joint initiatives.</p>
<p>Refcat represents one of the larger citation graph datasets of scholarly literature, as well as uniquely containing a notable portion of citations from works that do not have a DOI or persistent identifier. We hope this dataset will be a valuable community resource alongside other critical knowledge graph projects, including those with which we are collaborating, such as <a href="https://opencitations.net/">OpenCitations</a> and <a href="http://wikicite.org/">Wikicite</a>. </p>
<p>The Refcat dataset is released under a CC0 license and is <a href="https://archive.org/details/refcat_2021-07-28">available for download from archive.org</a>. The related software created for the extraction and matching process, including exact and fuzzy citation matching (<a href="https://gitlab.com/internetarchive/refcat">refcat</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/internetarchive/fuzzycat/">fuzzycat</a>), are also released as open-source tools. For those interested in technical details about the project, a white paper is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06595">available on arxiv.org</a> authored by IA engineers, including Martin Czygan, who led work on Refcat, and is described in <a href="https://guide.fatcat.wiki/reference_graph.html">our catalog user guide</a>.</p>
<p>What does Refcat mean for regular users of IA Scholar? Refcat results from work to ensure the interconnection between material within IA Scholar and other resources archived in Internet Archive in order to make browsing and lookups easier and to ensure overall citation integrity and persistence. For example, there are over 25 million web links in the citations in Refcat and we were able to match ~14 million of these to archived web pages in <a href="http://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> and also found that ~18% of these matched web citations are no longer available on the live web. Web links in citations not in Wayback Machine have been added to ongoing web harvests. We also matched over 20 million citations to books that are available for lending in our <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> service and matched over 1 million citations to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> entries. </p>
<p>Besides interconnection, Refcat will allow users to understand what works have cited a specific scholarly resource (i.e. “cited by” or “inbound citations”) that will help with improved discovery features. Finally, knowing the full “knowledge graph” of IA Scholar helps us better identify important scholarly material that we have not yet archived, thus improving the overall quality and extent of the collection. This, in turn, aids scholars by ensuring their open-access work is archived and accessible forever, especially for those whose publisher may not have the resources for long-term preservation, and it ensures that related outputs like research registrations or datasets are also archived, matched to the article of record, and available into the future.</p>
<p>The Refcat release is a milestone of Phase Two of our project, “Ensuring the Persistent Access of Long Tail Open Access Journal Literature,” <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2018/03/05/andrew-w-mellon-foundation-awards-grant-to-the-internet-archive-for-long-tail-journal-preservation/">first announced in 2018</a> and supported by funding from the <a href="https://mellon.org/grants/grants-database/grants/internet-archive/1910-07256/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>. Current work focuses on citation integrity within the IA Scholar archive, partnerships and services, such as our role in the multi-institutional <a href="https://doaj.org/preservation/">Project Jasper</a> and our partnership with <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2019/09/24/internet-archive-and-center-for-open-science-collaborate-to-preserve-open-science-data/">Center for Open Science</a>, and the addition of secondary scholarly outputs to IA Scholar, including datasets, software, and other non-article/book scholarly materials. Lookout for a plethora of announcements about other IA Scholar milestones in the coming months!</p>

<p>As part of our partnership, we are releasing a series of publicly available datasets created from archived web collections. Alongside these efforts, the project is also launching a Cohort Program providing funding and technical support for research teams interested in studying web archive collections. These twin efforts aim to help build the infrastructure and services to allow more researchers to leverage web archives in their scholarly work. More details on the new public datasets and the cohorts program are below. </p>
<p><strong>Early Web Datasets</strong></p>
<p>Our first in a series of public datasets from the web collections are oriented around the theme of the early web. These are, of course, datasets intended for data mining and researchers using computational tools to study large amounts of data, so are absent the informational or nostalgia value of looking at archived webpages in the Wayback Machine. If the latter is more your interest, here is an archived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040312165034/http://www.geocities.com/linda6619/caitlinsgraphics.html">Geocities page with unicorn GIFs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>GeoCities Collection (1994–2009)</strong></p>
<p>As one of the first platforms for creating web pages without expertise, Geocities lowered the barrier of entry for a new generation of website creators. There were at least 38 million pages displayed by GeoCities before it was terminated by Yahoo! in 2009. This dataset collection contains a number of individual datasets that include data such as domain counts, image graph and web graph data, and binary file information for a variety of file formats like audio, video, and text and image files. A graphml file is also available for the domain graph.</p>
<p>GeoCities Dataset Collection: <a href="https://archive.org/details/geocitiesdatasets" class="uri">https://archive.org/details/geocitiesdatasets</a></p>
<p><strong>Friendster (2003–2015)</strong></p>
<p>Friendster was an early and widely used social media networking site where users were able to establish and maintain layers of shared connections with other users. This dataset collection contains  graph files that allow data-driven research to explore how certain pages within Friendster linked to each other. It also contains a dataset that provides some basic metadata about the individual files within the archival collection. </p>
<p>Friendster Dataset Collection: <a href="https://archive.org/details/friendsterdatasets" class="uri">https://archive.org/details/friendsterdatasets</a></p>
<p><strong>Early Web Language Datasets (1996–1999)</strong></p>
<p>These two related datasets were generated from the Internet Archive’s global web archive collection. The first dataset, “Parallel Language Records of the Early Web (1996–1999)” provides a dataset of multilingual records, or URLs of websites that have the same text represented in multiple languages. Such multi-language text from websites are a rich source for parallel language corpora and can be valuable in machine translation. The second dataset, “Language Annotations of the Early Web (1996–1999)” is another metadata set that annotates the language of over four million websites using Compact Language Detector (CLD3).</p>

We are hosting an informal hackathon working with White House social media data, government web data, and data from election-related collections. We will provide more gov data than you can shake a script at! If you are interested in attending, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfswmGhE8ZbF0VHlY48bXOtu9E4IbRwzpAjYIPfCDZgHjqjjw/viewform">please register using this form</a>. The event will take place at our 300 Funston Avenue headquarters from 10am-5pm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We have been working with the White House on their admirable project to provide public access to eight years of White House social media data for research and creative reuse. Read more on their efforts at <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/participate/opening-our-data-public">this blog post</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Copies of this data will be publicly accessible at <a href="https://archive.org/index.php">archive.org</a>. We have also been furiously archiving the federal government web as part of our collaborative <a href="https://archive.org/details/EndOfTerm2016WebCrawls&amp;tab=about">End of Term Web Archive</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and have also collected a voluminous amount of media and web data as part of the 2016 election cycle. Data from these projects — and others — will be made publicly accessible for folks to analyze, study, and do fun, interesting things with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Saturday’s hackathon, we will give an overview of the datasets available, have short talks from affiliated projects and services, and point to tools and methods for analyzing the hackathon’s data. We plan for a loose, informal event. Some datasets that will be available for the event and publicly accessible online:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Obama Administration White House social media from 2009-current, including Twitter, Tumblr, Vine, Facebook, and (possibly) YouTube</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Comprehensive web archive data of current White House websites: whitehouse.gov, petitions.whitehouse.gov, letsmove.gov and other .gov websites</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">The End of Term Web Archives, a large-scale collaborative effort to preserve the federal government web ( .gov/.mil) at presidential transitions, including web data from 2008, 2012, and our current 2016 project</span></li>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Python notebooks, cluster computing tools, and pointers to methods for playing with data at scale.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> Much of this data was collected in partnership with other libraries and with the support of external funders. We thank, foremost, the current White House Office of Digital Strategy staff for their advocacy for open access and working with us and others to make their social media open to the public. We also thank our <a href="http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/partners.html">End of Term Web Archive partners</a> and related community efforts helping preserve the .gov web, as well as the funders that have supported many of the collecting and engineering efforts that makes all this data publicly accessible, including the <a href="https://www.imls.gov/">Institute of Museum and Library Services</a>, <a href="https://www.altiscale.com/">Altiscale</a>, <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/">the Knight Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.democracyfund.org/">the Democracy Fund</a>, the Kahle-Austin Foundation, and others.</span></p>

<p>Posted on <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2016/12/15/preserving-u-s-government-websites-and-data-as-the-obama-term-ends/" title="6:14 am">December 15, 2016</a><span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/jefferson/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by jefferson">jefferson</a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Long before the 2016 Presidential election cycle librarians have understood this often-overlooked fact: vast amounts of government data and digital information are at risk of vanishing when a presidential term ends and administrations change.  For example, 83% of .gov pdf’s disappeared <a href="http://vphill.com/journal/post/5872/">between 2008 and 2012.</a><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is why the Internet Archive, </span><a href="http://digital2.library.unt.edu/nomination/eth2016/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400">along with partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from the Library of Congress, University of North Texas, George Washington University, Stanford University, California Digital Library, and other public and private libraries, are hard at work on the </span><a href="http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">End of Term Web Archive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, a wide-ranging effort to preserve the entirety of the federal government web presence, especially the .gov and .mil domains, along with federal websites on other domains and official government social media accounts.</span></p>
<p>While not the only project the Internet Archive is doing to preserve government websites, ftp sites, and databases at this time, the End of Term Web Archive is a far reaching one.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Internet Archive is <a href="https://archive.org/details/EndOfTerm2016WebCrawls">collecting webpages</a> from over 6,000 government domains, over 200,000 hosts, and feeds from around 10,000 official federal social media accounts. The effort is likely to preserve hundreds of millions of individual government webpages and data and could end up totaling well over 100 terabytes of data of archived materials. Over its full history of web archiving, the Internet Archive has preserved over 3.5 billion URLs from the .gov domain including over 45 million PDFs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This end-of-term collection builds on similar initiatives in 2008 and 2012 by original partners Internet Archive, Library of Congress, University of North Texas, and California Digital Library to document the “gov web,” which has no mandated, domain-wide single custodian. For instance, here is the National Institute of Literacy (NIFL) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080510045239/http://www.nifl.gov/">website in 2008</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. The domain went offline in 2011. Similarly, the Sustainable Development Indicators (SDI) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080617165028/http://www.sdi.gov/">site</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> was later taken down. Other websites, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010203235300/http://invasivespecies.gov/">invasivespecies.gov</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">were later folded into larger agency domains. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Every web page archived is accessible through the <a href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> and past and current End of Term specific collections are full-text searchable through the main <a href="http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/">End of Term portal</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. We have also worked with additional partners to provide access to the full data for use in data-mining research and projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The project has received considerable press attention this year, with related stories in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/01/nyregion/harvesting-government-history-one-web-page-at-a-time.html">The New York Times</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-federal-data-fears-232591">Politico</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/13/scientists-are-frantically-copying-u-s-climate-data-fearing-it-might-vanish-under-trump/">The Washington Post</a>, <a href="http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2016/12/industry-news/government-website-harvest-enlists-librarians-educators-students/">Library Journal</a>, <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/researchers-are-preparing-for-trump-to-delete-government-science-from-the-web">Motherboard</a>, and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No single government entity is responsible for archiving the entire federal government’s web presence,” explained Jefferson Bailey, the Internet Archive’s Director of Web Archiving.  “Web data is already highly ephemeral and websites without a mandated custodian are even more imperiled. These sites include significant amounts of publicly-funded federal research, data, projects, and reporting that may only exist or be published on the web. This is tremendously important historical information. It also creates an amazing opportunity for libraries and archives to join forces and resources and collaborate to archive and provide permanent access to this material.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This year has also seen a significant increase in citizen and librarian driven “hackathons” and “nomination-a-thons” where subject experts and concerned information professionals crowdsource lists of high-value or endangered websites for the End of Term archiving partners to crawl. Librarian groups in New York City are holding </span><a href="http://metro.org/events/806/"><span style="font-weight: 400">nomination events</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to make sure important sites are preserved. And universities such as  The University of Toronto are <a href="http://www.metronews.ca/news/toronto/2016/12/13/toronto-group-to-save-science-data-from-trump-.html">holding events</a> for “<a href="https://www.ischool.utoronto.ca/content/guerrilla-archiving-event-saving-environmental-data-trump">guerrilla archiving</a>” focused specifically on preserving climate related data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We need your help too! You can use the </span><a href="http://digital2.library.unt.edu/nomination/eth2016/"><span style="font-weight: 400">End of Term Nomination Tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to nominate any .gov or government website or social media site and it will be archived by the project team.   If you have other ideas, please comment here or send ideas to <a href="mailto:info@archive.org?subject=Gov-archiving">info@archive.org</a>.   And you can also help by <a href="https://archive.org/donate/">donating to the Internet Archive</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> to help our continued mission to provide “Universal Access to All Knowledge.”</span></p>

<h1 id="hacking-web-archives"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/2016/08/31/hacking-web-archives/">Hacking Web Archives</a></h1>
<p>Posted on <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2016/08/31/hacking-web-archives/" title="8:54 am">August 31, 2016</a><span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/jefferson/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by jefferson">jefferson</a></span></span></p>
<p>The awkward teenage years of the web archive are over. It is now 27 years since Tim Berners-Lee created the web and 20 years since we at Internet Archive set out to systematically archive web content. As the web gains evermore “historicity” (i.e., it’s old and getting older — just like you!), it is increasingly recognized as a valuable historical record of interest to researchers and others working to study it at scale.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, it has been exciting to see — and for us to support and participate in — a number of recent efforts in the scholarly and library/archives communities to hold hackathons and datathons focused on getting web archives into the hands of research and users. The events have served to help build a collaborative framework to encourage more use, more exploration, more tools and services, and more hacking (and similar levels of the sometime-maligned-but-ever-valuable yacking) to support research use of web archives. Get the data to the people!</span></p>

Over 15 researchers came together to analyze almost two dozen subject-based web archives created by institutions using our <a href="https://archive-it.org/">Archive-It</a> service. Universities, archives, museums, and others contributed web archive collections on topics ranging from the <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/2950">Occupy Movement</a> to <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/1068">Human Rights</a> to <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/2973">Contemporary Women Artists on the Web</a>. Hackathon teams geo-located IP addresses, analyzed sentiments and entities in webpage text, and studied mime type distributions.</span></p>

The fantastic team organizing these two Archives Unleashed hackathons have created an excellent model for bringing together transdisciplinary researchers and librarians/archivists to foster work with web data. In both Archives Unleashed events, attendees formed into self-selecting teams to work together on specific analytical approaches and with specific web archive collections and datasets provided by Library of Congress, Internet Archive, University of Toronto, GWU’s <a href="https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/">Social Feed Manager</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">, and others. The <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/hackarchives">#hackarchives</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> tweet stream gives some insight into the hacktivities, and the top projects were presented at the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/loc/kluge/news/save-web-2016.html">Save The Web</a> symposium</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> held at LC’s <a href="https://www.loc.gov/loc/kluge/">Kluge Center</a> the day after the event.</span></p>
<p>Both events show a bright future for expanding new access models, scholarship, and collaborations around building and using web archives. Plus, nobody crashed the wi-fi at any of these events! Yay!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Special thanks go to <a href="https://www.altiscale.com/">Altiscale</a> (and Start Smart Labs) and <a href="https://www.computecanada.ca/">ComputeCanada</a> for providing cluster computing services to support these events. Thanks also go to the multiple funding agencies, including NSF and SSHRC, that provided funding, and to the many co-sponsoring and hosting institutions. Super special thanks go to key organizers, Helge Holzman and Avishek Anand at L3S and Matt Weber, Ian Milligan, and Jimmy Lin at Archives Unleashed, who made these events a rollicking success.</span></p>
