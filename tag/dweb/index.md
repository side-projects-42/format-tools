*The September 2021 DWeb Meetup explored the potential and reality of decentralized storage with two projects leading the way toward storing highly valuable cultural data at scale.*

*Watch the recording of the event and learn more about the speakers below.*

The September 2021 DWeb meetup was held virtually on Tuesday, September 28, 2021 at 10am PT, optimized for American/European time zones. Wendy Hanamura welcomed attendees and kicked off the meetup. Brewster Kahle, the founder of the Internet Archive, set the stage for the discussion by emphasising the need for a more secure and decentralized web. The Meetup also broached the possibility of a DWeb camp in the Fall of 2022.

The discussion explained the differences between the IPFS and Filecoin systems, how they work together and delved into the two projects led by Arkadiy Kukarkin and Jonathan Dotan which are at the cutting edge of storing large scale data of high cultural significance in the Filecoin network. They discussed the challenges, successes, and future opportunities presented by these efforts.

Lastly, attendees welcomed Eseohe “Ese” Ojo, the new DWeb Projects Organizer and said farewell to Mai Ishikawa Sutton as she goes off to grad school in Japan. Mai will continue to stay connected with the DWeb community and can be reached on Twitter [@maira](https://twitter.com/maira). Ese can be reached at <dweb@archive.org> or on Twitter [@EseoheOjo](http://twitter.com/eseoheojo). The meetup wrapped up with socializing and networking in Gather.town. 

The next DWeb Meetup **“DWeb Meetup Nov 2021 – Centering Respect, Trust and Equity in the DWeb”** is scheduled for Thursday, November 4, 2021 at 5pm PT, optimized for Asia time zones. At this meetup, we will hear the latest in the DWeb and from our featured speaker Coraline Ada Ehmke on centering respect, trust, and equity in the DWeb. You can read Coraline’s blog post on the DWeb principle of Mutual Respect [here](https://blog.archive.org/2021/09/03/the-sacred-geometry-of-respect-trust-and-equity/). 

We’re interested in hearing from DWeb projects about the breakthroughs, challenges, and new roadmaps they might be exploring. For anyone interested in participating in lightning rounds at this meetup, let us know [here](https://form.jotform.com/203236908715154).

In 2021, Coraline founded the [Organization for Ethical Source](https://ethicalsource.dev) and currently serves as its Executive Director.*

In his 1976 paper “Communication and Cultural Domination,” sociologist and media critic Herbert Schiller warned of a future in which the cultural lives of individuals around the globe would be shaped and dictated by a small number of private media interests. The domination of US tech corporations in the online world today is the grim fulfillment of that prophecy. 

Access to the vast store of collective human knowledge is increasingly predicated on the surrender of our rights of privacy, free association, and digital autonomy to gatekeepers like Google, Amazon, and Facebook, whose entire business models depend on the normalization of surveillance capitalism. And digital colonization — the violent and repressive imposition of Western values and taxonomies — is a fundamental component of their success.

> “The internet is implicated in contemporary power structures, its promise tarnished by unaccountable digital corporations, data extractivism, the marketisation of democracy and network capitalism’s connivance with surveillance states.”
>
> (Anita Gurumurthy and Nandini Chami, “Towards a political practice of empowerment in digital times: a feminist commentary from the global South”)

Realizing the potential of the web to democratize the advance of human knowledge while preserving cultural autonomy and promoting universal human rights requires more than a begrudging (and often patronizing) nod to “global perspectives” interpreted through the lens of the Silicon Valley ethos. Achieving just outcomes requires actively prioritizing both equal access and equitable participation across social and cultural boundaries.

And this begins with centering the foundational principles of mutual respect, trust, and equity.

> “Tolerance is the privilege of the powerful: it is the granting of permission to deviate from the norms of the majority. And it comes with the unspoken threat that this permission can be revoked at any time.”

Mutual Respect
==============

Achieving mutual respect is essential for effective communication and collaboration, and plays an especially critical role in conflict resolution. 

It is important to distinguish between respect and tolerance. Tolerance is the privilege of the powerful: it is the granting of permission to deviate from the norms of the majority. And it comes with the unspoken threat that this permission can be revoked at any time. Asking the powerless to accept mere “tolerance” is asking them to endure their oppression for the comfort or convenience of their oppressors.

> “That is the problem with toleration: others determine if they tolerate you, which rules and norms you need to meet in order to be allowed to participate.”
>
> (Petra De Sutter and Bruno De Lille, “Wij willen niet getolereerd worden, wij willen respect”)

Honoring and respecting personal, social, and cultural differences in our digital communities starts with defining clear and consensual social contracts that establish the rights, responsibilities, and privileges of participation. 

Codes of conduct are important in creating and sustaining an environment of mutual respect, but in order to be effective they must be enforced consistently and fairly. This requires the additional layer of clear and transparent governance. Fostering a culture of mutual respect starts with making social contracts explicit, continually reassessing their impact, and evolving their conditions to address changes both within a community and in the world at large.

Sustaining a culture that respects our differences, rather than simply tolerating them, creates opportunities to leverage the richness and diversity of our communities for the greater good.

Trust
=====

Building trust begins with an expectation of positive intent, and develops over time through mutual accountability. Trust is earned and sustained by accepting responsibility for our actions and their outcomes.

> “Without trust, conflict is politics. With trust, conflict is the pursuit of truth.”
>
> (Patrick Lencioni, “The Five Dysfunctions of a Team”)

Social scientists recognize two main forms of trust: cognitive trust and affective trust.

Cognitive trust is valued predominantly in Western cultures and is based on confidence in someone else’s skills and reliability. It is fostered by a continual display of competence and reliability, and is essentially transactional.

Affective trust is more prevalent in the Global South and Asia. This form of trust develops from a sense of emotional closeness, demonstrations of empathy, or even feelings of friendship. It is relational rather than transactional.

As with respect, trust must be considered within the context of power dynamics. Distrust toward those with power often has little or no real consequence to them, but withholding trust from the disadvantaged or disenfranchised only magnifies the impact of systemic inequalities. This is why it’s essential that those with power earn and sustain trust through *what they do*, while, in turn, extending trust to others by accepting and recognizing them for *who they are*.

Trust in a global context requires acknowledging, valuing, and developing both kinds of trust in our communities.

Equity
======

Equity is difficult to define, because there are so few examples of true equity in our world to draw from. One way of thinking about equity is a lack of disparity in agency across racial, ethnic, gendered, and other dimensions. The meaningful pursuit of equity requires interrupting the societal, institutional, and interpersonal injustices that sustain these disparities.

> “New manifestations of racism and other forms of oppression continue to emerge and outpace our mechanisms and capacities to solve them… To be achieved and sustained, equity needs to be thought of as a structural and systemic concept.”
>
> (Race Equity and Inclusion Action Guide, Annie E. Casey Foundation)

Equity is not synonymous with equality. Equality assumes that everyone has the same needs and can succeed given the same opportunities. Meritocracy, widely heralded in the online world as a force for equality, is founded on the idea that our differences are irrelevant to success, rather than a contributor to success. This dangerously flawed premise, combined with an unwillingness to acknowledge intrinsic power imbalances, has only served to compound the impact of deeply-rooted disparities in the digital world.

> “To effect meaningful change, those whose authority and privilege are sustained by inequity must yield power and distribute agency to those who are most impacted by systemic disparities.”

Inequity is not a problem that can be solved from first principles. Those with power cannot define what is or is not equitable. Deciding what’s best for the marginalized, rather than meaningfully empowering them to make these determinations for themselves, is itself a manifestation of inequity.  Racism and other forms of oppression are self-perpetuating and constantly evolve in response to efforts to mitigate them, so strategies for addressing these issues must also evolve and adapt. Focusing exclusively on “quick fixes,” for example, outreach without corresponding investments in cultural and structural change, often do more harm than good.

Injustice cannot be cured by mere consultation, engagement, or representation. To effect meaningful change, those whose authority and privilege are sustained by inequity must yield power and distribute agency to those who are most impacted by systemic disparities.

Closing the Circle
==================

The values of respect, trust, and equity are interconnected and inseparable. Putting them into practice means continually reassessing and re-imagining what a just world might look like. It means acknowledging that the same technologies we create and use with the intent of realizing these ideals, can (and will) be abused to instead sustain and magnify systemic injustice — at an otherwise unimaginable scale.

Values that are expressed but that do not guide our actions are merely performative. Real progress can only come about when we go beyond our good intentions, and take responsibility for impact and outcomes. Ultimately, we are accountable not only to our collaborators and our users, but also to our broader global society.

Descriptions of Speakers and Their Lightning Talks
--------------------------------------------------

### 1. Dietrich Ayala, Ecosystem Lead, IPFS

*Big is Small is Big: IPFS Usage, Users and Use-cases in 2020*

As adoption and availability of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) grew in 2020, we saw it used across a broad spectrum of applications, varying widely in industry category, use-case, architecture and more. IPFS ecosystem lead Dietrich Ayala will speedrun through a sampling of these, sharing what was learned and how our users are guiding the IPFS project into 2021

Twitter: [@dietrich](https://twitter.com/dietrich)

### 2. Yisi Liu, Founder, DWeb Meetup Shanghai

*A Volunteer-based Mesh Network Workshop in China Academy of Art*

DWeb Shanghai, along with the Institute of Network Society at China Academy of Art, [co-hosted a special workshop this month on building mesh networks](https://www.caa-ins.org/archives/6927/2) at its fifth annual conference. Yisi will share what they did and what they learned from the workshop and its participants.

Twitter: [@TheYisiLiu](https://twitter.com/TheYisiLiu)

### 3. Karissa McKelvey, Researcher, Simply Secure

[*Decentralization Off The Shelf*](https://decentpatterns.xyz/)*: Patterns x Decentralized Applications*

It’s hard to get started building a decentralized application. Even if you’ve been building them for years, it’s hard to get them adopted. Decentralized applications operate differently than centralized ones — and we need new tools that developers and designers can use to understand how to build applications. Simply Secure is now producing a library of resources, assets, and patterns to support the design and development of better user-facing applications that are backed by decentralized architecture.

Twitter: [@okdistribute](https://twitter.com/okdistribute)

### 4. Mark Nadal, Founder, Gun.eco

Founded in 2014, [GUN](https://gun.eco/) is an open source cybersecurity protocol for synchronizing graph data in decentralized mesh networks. It is as easy as Firebase yet supports end-to-end encryption and uses “CRDT” algorithms instead of a Blockchain.

In 2020, GUN hit 200M+ downloads with 30M monthly active users. The project is powered by 2 full time staff, 10 part-time volunteers, and 100+ contributors.

Twitter: [@marknadal](https://twitter.com/marknadal)

### 5. Adam Souzis, One Commons

*Building an Open Cloud at OneCommons*

“At the DWeb Camp in 2019 I led a brainstorming session on how we can build a cloud providing the same openness and freedoms to users and developers as open source. One year and a pandemic later, I’m excited to finally release the first step in pursuit of that vision: “ensembles”, git repositories that package open cloud services.

They are designed to be the building blocks of an open and decentralized cloud infrastructure: reproducible, relocatable and shareable. Decentralization is obtained via a notion of a persistent identity that is defined not by a network location but rather a reproducible state.”

### 6. Paul Frazee, Founder, Breaker Browser

*Beaker Browser 1.0: Share P2P Websites*

“Unless there was a disaster between my talk-submission and Thursday, then [Beaker Browser 1.0](https://beakerbrowser.com) is now available! Join us for a quick overview of building and sharing peer-to-peer Websites with this newest release.”

Twitter: [@pfrazee](https://twitter.com/pfrazee)

### 7. Maria Bustillos, Co-Founder, Brick House Co-operative

*Decorporatizing the Public Sphere*

Megaplatforms from Amazon to Facebook to Penguin Random House have flattened and centralized the human imagination. Netizens know that something is draining out of our world, that there’s less variety, less brilliance, and fewer surprises, in our movies, music, and writing. But it’s not clear to most that this cultural deterioration is the result of a breakneck form of capitalism enabled by technology.

[The Brick House Cooperative](http://thebrick.house/), launching December 8th, is addressing this problem as writers and artists, ‘from the other side’. They’re looking to join forces with technologists and others interested in decorporatizing media. Maria will also share how her previous experience with Civil, a blockchain-based media platform that aimed to fund journalism, will inform her work with The Brick House.

Twitter: [@mariabustillos](https://twitter.com/mariabustillos)

### 8. Mauve Signweaver, Founder, Agregore

*Agregore: Local-First Web Of Everything*

[Agregore](https://agregore.mauve.moe/) is a local-first web browser which aims to simplify application development across different peer-to-peer protocols while staying as minimal and customizable as possible. Through Agregore, Mauve is trying to address the issue of web browsers not having access to full peer-to-peer protocols. They want to make creating local-first apps easier by simplifying the programming interface and app distribution method.

Twitter: [@RangerMauve](https://twitter.com/RangerMauve)

### 9. Tom Trowbridge, Founder, Fluence Labs

[Fluence Labs](https://fluence.network/) was established in 2017 by 3 founders, Dmitry Kurinskiy, Tom Trowbridge and Evgeny Ponomarev. They started in 2017 and spent a lot of time researching and experimenting with decentralized computing. Just recently, in November 2020 they launched Phase 1 of Fluence: the decentralized computing protocol that allows applications to build on each other, share data and users. They call it an open application platform.

The goal of Fluence is to enable the next wave of internet innovation by turning the competition into collaboration. Fluence creates an open alternative to proprietary platforms, enabling developers to build with confidence and be fairly compensated for usage.

Twitter[: @Fluence\_Project](https://twitter.com/fluence_project)

### 10. Travis Vachon, itme

*Self Determination for our Digital Bodies with Solid*

Centralized tech monopolies and other large corporations capture the vast majority of the value of the world’s data in 2020. In order to create the conditions necessary to return this value to the world’s users, we need new politico-technical-social institutions that give users the ability to provide and retract informed consent over the ways their data is used. [itme](https://itme.company) is building the world’s first cooperatively owned and operated data union built on Tim Berners-Lee’s new Solid web standard to let users reassemble their digital bodies and capture the value of the data they create.

Twitter: [@itmepress](https://twitter.com/itmepress)

### 11. Brandon Wallace, President, PLAN Systems

[PLAN Systems](https://www.plan-systems.org/) is a technology 501(c)(3) founded in 2018 by two U.S. veterans in Austin TX., including Drew O’Meara, inventor of G-Force realtime audio reactive music visualizations. Their development effort centers on building a framework of open protocols and universally accessible interfaces designed for privacy, real time collaboration, data visualization, and secure data storage & portability. November was a critical milestone, demonstrating PLAN (pre-alpha) running on 4 major platforms across desktop and mobile devices.

### 12. Michael Toomim, Braid

*How* [*Braid*](https://braid.news) *is growing, from Dweb to the IETF*

“At 2019’s Dwebcamp, a group of us found a back room and spontaneously designed a shared protocol for distributed synchronization. Tim Berners-Lee walked by, and thought it would be a great addition to the web.

We will report on what’s happened since!

We presented the protocol to the IETF’s HTTP Working Group in Montreal, and received a surprisingly enthusiastic reception. We are now building software on the protocol, to show how HTTP can be extended into a distributed shared fabric for local-first applications, users, and systems, with great debugging and tooling.”

On September 22, DWeb San Francisco invited a panel of experts to share their views on the most viable paths forward. The panelists included author & EFF advisor **Cory Doctorow**, Matrix.org co-founder **Amandine Le Pape**, decentralized social media researcher **Jay Graber**, and TechDirt’s **Mike Masnick**. They covered a range of approaches — including technical, regulatory, and organizational — that could bring us towards a future where our networks are more resilient, participatory, and decentralized.

**ABOUT THE PANELISTS:**

[Best-selling science fiction author](https://craphound.com/) and [EFF Special Advisor](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/cory-doctorow), Cory Doctorow, emphasized that we need to fix the Internet, not the tech companies by doing a lot more to bring back principles of interoperability, to enable more competition and innovation. 

Developer, and founder of Happening, [Jay Graber](https://medium.com/@jaygraber), shared her insights on what she found hopeful about the decentralized web ecosystem, and some of the challenges that some of these protocols still need to grapple with moving forward. 

Chief Operating Officer of Element and Co-founder of the [Matrix.org](https://matrix.org/) Foundation, [Amandine Le Pape](https://element.io/blog/author/amandine/), shared what she learned as Matrix built a new open standard for real-time communication from the ground up, as well as her ideas on how to counter the information silos of the big centralized platforms. 

Journalist and co-founder of Techdirt, [Mike Masnick](https://www.techdirt.com/user/mmasnick), shared about the way people were realizing the need for change, and also some of his skepticism about how some proposed regulations to enforce interoperability may harm start-ups and other less-resourced projects. Masnick’s 2019 white paper, “[Protocols, Not Platforms: A Technological Approach to Free Speech](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech)” has been an influential call to arms for the decentralized tech community.

As Mike Masnick writes:

*At a time when so many proposals for how to deal with the big internet companies seem focused on spite and anger at those companies, rather than thoughtful discussions of how we get to what’s coming next, at the very least I’m hopeful that others can be inspired…to come up with their own ideas for a better, more proactive approach to a future internet.*

Ultimately, that vision—building a better Internet and Web—is the North Star that the DWeb community aims for.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DWeb_CommunityViews.jpeg" class="wp-image-21162" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DWeb_CommunityViews.jpeg 800w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DWeb_CommunityViews-300x150.jpeg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DWeb_CommunityViews-768x384.jpeg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DWeb_CommunityViews-624x312.jpeg 624w" width="800" height="400" /></figure>People’s access to accurate, reliable information is always essential. Of course, it becomes ever more critical during a global pandemic like COVID. 

But giving people “internet access” alone is not enough. For information to be useful to people, the means of access cannot be a one-way street. Information is social. Information must be contextualized. What are the spoken languages, levels of reading literacy, ways of life, and the legacies of systemic oppression? Community networks take a holistic approach to information and communication technology. Instead of seeing people as passive users, people are active participants, co-creating media through collaborative processes, thereby making it more inherently more accessible than content produced elsewhere.

These are some of the main takeaways from the [DWeb Meetup on July 29, 2020](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dweb-meetup-july2020-community-views-around-the-globe-tickets-114369343786#). Four [DWeb Camp 2019](https://dwebcamp.org/) Global Fellows shared how their community networks in South Africa, Brazil and India are adapting to COVID. Though they can connect to the World Wide Web, the fact that these networks maintain steady connectivity between local nodes with locally-hosted content is in many ways more valuable than their internet access.

So how do their community networks steward connectivity and information in this way? How do they work with their communities to produce local knowledge that feeds their networks?

Community Networks Contextualize Information
--------------------------------------------

Sol Luca de Tena, director of [Zenzeleni Networks](https://zenzeleni.net/) Non-Profit Corporation (NPC), spoke with us from Cape Town, South Africa. Zenzeleni Networks supports and seeds cooperatively-owned community networks. There are currently two community networks, Zenzeleni Mankosi Cooperative and Zenzeleni Zithulele Cooperative. Together they cover 19 villages and are the first legally-recognized community networks that are owned and governed by their members in South Africa. 

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-11.52.39-PM.png" class="wp-image-21155" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-11.52.39-PM.png 902w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-11.52.39-PM-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-11.52.39-PM-768x433.png 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-11.52.39-PM-624x352.png 624w" width="451" height="255" /></figure>She described how the problem in rural South Africa went beyond having access to reliable information. The public health information regarding COVID was not even useful given the realities of people, especially given that it was not even available in their languages:

> “So imagine in your \[urban\] setting, all the \[COVID safety\] guidelines that are being published by the government and by doctors, are about how to stay safe when using a communal tap. How to stay safe when taking your cattle out, or tending for your crops. Amidst the anxiety of knowing what to do, what’s real, what’s not. When the information is not contextual, and it’s not even in your first, or second, or third language, imagine the strain that creates.”

The Zenzeleni community networks serve areas where, over the last decade, its network was largely built alongside its energy infrastructure. Its lack of public services and infrastructure was a direct legacy of underdevelopment due to the Apartheid regime. When national and international health guidelines on COVID assume access to running water and other amenities, it just was not helpful or relevant.

“Our Stories, Our Internet”
---------------------------

Two of Zenzeleni’s initiatives were started to address this. The first was the Digital Community Notice Board. Though they had already zero-rated many websites for health and educational resources, they were finding that it was difficult to filter and make sense of it. The Notice Board curates information from credible sources, carries videos in local languages, and empowers people to filter information that is relevant to them.

It came out of the need for more content that is locally-created by indigenous black community members. The challenge calls for content in audio and visual formats and makes the content freely available on the networks across 65 hotspots. Those who create the works can win cash prizes to incentivize people to contribute and help people financially.

Sol emphasized that we need to think about tech as being not separate from people’s lives. The internet is a means to an end, not an end unto itself. Our networks ought to come out of our communities, and be designed according to actual felt needs.

Nodes that Bond
---------------

Marcela Guerra joined us from Monteiro Lobato, in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo. She helps with her neighborhood association, [Portal Sem Porteiras](https://portalsemporteiras.github.io/), whose main project is operating a local community mesh network. The network uses [Altermundi](https://altermundi.net/)’s [Libre Routers](https://libremesh.org) for its 18 nodes and has over 200+ devices connected. They use [Pirania](https://github.com/libremesh/pirania/), a captive portal system also built by Altermundi, to moderate the use of the network and gather micropayments to help pay for the ISP connection.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.51.34-AM-1024x580.png" class="wp-image-21148" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.51.34-AM-1024x580.png 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.51.34-AM-300x170.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.51.34-AM-768x435.png 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.51.34-AM-624x354.png 624w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.51.34-AM.png 1182w" width="512" height="290" /></figure>Marcela discussed the organizational hurdles of maintaining the network. With more than 12 people volunteering to maintain it, they made big changes to the way they organized themselves and have made its management more decentralized. They split themselves into five territories, where each group of volunteers is responsible for the connectivity issue of each area’s network. 

But as a community network, she said, the work can get very personal. Marcela said that neighbors often knock on the doors of network maintainers when they need internet connection. So they created a virtual channel with a made-up character to help answer those queries. A person is actually answering them behind the scenes, but the character helps to prevent people from getting attached to specific people. 

Of course, since all the volunteers are members of the communities themselves, it can be difficult to manage their time and priorities when you live there 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Marcela said that they’re trying to get more involved and are working on better governance so they can consider all their members’ perspectives and adapt as best they can.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.51.53-AM-1024x584.png" class="wp-image-21149" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.51.53-AM-1024x584.png 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.51.53-AM-300x171.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.51.53-AM-768x438.png 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.51.53-AM-624x356.png 624w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.51.53-AM.png 1181w" width="512" height="292" /></figure>In the meantime, they are opening a new physical location, a hub, for their community network. It’s a well-ventilated house where people can exchange knowledge and take care of personal business — to pay their bills, use a printer, and other tasks people need specialized devices to do. 

The other project Marcela coordinates is called [Nodes that Bond](https://www.apc.org/en/node/36020), which works to shift women’s relationships with technology. They used to have in-person monthly women’s circles to build trust and connection with each other, which was important as they shared personal stories and shaped what they wanted to be able to do with their community network. 

Since the pandemic began however, they replaced the women’s circles with a podcast that collects testimonials on various subjects. Some of the episodes help women navigate tech documentation, and others help them as they go through a digital security orientation. She is now working with her team on an audio novella based on research from 2019 about local women’s stories of domestic violence. In order to anonymize the women’s identities, the novella will weave those into one story of a fictional woman. 

Marcela combines creativity and practical approaches to ensure her local network is both sustainable and accessible to the women and underserved in her community. 

Scrap Laptops + Raspberry Pis + Kolibri
---------------------------------------

Hiure Queiroz, tech lead of [Coolab](https://coolab.org), supports the creation and maintenance of community networks in his local area. Like most places in the world, education in his community has been hugely impacted by COVID. He talked about how he is using the local mesh (which Marcela mentioned runs on Libre Routers) to provide educational resources to students. 

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.41.00-AM-1024x580.png" class="wp-image-21151" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.41.00-AM-1024x580.png 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.41.00-AM-300x170.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.41.00-AM-768x435.png 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.41.00-AM-624x354.png 624w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.41.00-AM.png 1184w" width="512" height="290" /></figure>Hiure is relying on [Kolibri](https://learningequality.org/kolibri/), an offline educational application built by Learning Equality, which he said was the best app he found for peer-to-peer networks. He is equipping scrapped laptops with Raspberry Pis to wirelessly mesh the devices to build the peer-to-peer network. He named these devices “Frankenberries”. Students and teachers can then use the Frankenberriess to access the educational materials on Kolibri. 

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.43.10-AM-1024x581.png" class="wp-image-21152" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.43.10-AM-1024x581.png 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.43.10-AM-300x170.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.43.10-AM-768x436.png 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.43.10-AM-624x354.png 624w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-8.43.10-AM.png 1158w" width="512" height="291" /></figure>Previously, students had to read and access educational materials on their parents’ mobile phones. With the Frankenberry laptops, students can more easily read and interact with the materials. Hiure is holding study groups with students and teachers to train them in using this system. 

In order to meet the urgent educational needs of his community under COVID, Hiure is building devices and fashioning them with the materials teachers require to teach their students. Just as important to this is the training he is holding to onboard them. 

Building Local Knowledge with Hypermedia and Mesh Mash Networks
---------------------------------------------------------------

Last but not least was TB Dinesh, who presented his work with [Janastu](http://iruway.janastu.org), and [Servelots](http://www.servelots.com/). He is building free and open source technologies to address the needs of populations in the Global South, particularly indigenous communities and those experiencing systemic inequity and prejudice. Dinesh’s passion is building the tools for a truly inclusive Web, one that takes into account that still a large population of the world have low reading literacy.

Dinesh is based in a village that lies on top of a hill next to a valley, about one hour from the city of Bangalore in India. A mesh network connects his village to other villages across the valley. 

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-11.49.28-PM-1.png" class="wp-image-21159" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-11.49.28-PM-1.png 904w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-11.49.28-PM-1-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-11.49.28-PM-1-768x433.png 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-11.49.28-PM-1-624x352.png 624w" width="452" height="255" /></figure>Janastu has built a radio storytelling platform atop that mesh network, enabling people to share their stories and knowledge using audio and visual media. They converted old phone booths into nodes for the radio, called [Namdu1Radio](https://www.namdu1radio.com). They are equipped with Raspberry Pis that allow people to walk up to listen to other people’s recordings or record their own with a push of a button. Dinesh noted that making the technology approachable this way is crucial. By making use of familiar infrastructure, like a phone booth, you can more easily embed new technology. 

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-10.23.38-AM-1024x575.png" class="wp-image-21153" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-10.23.38-AM-1024x575.png 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-10.23.38-AM-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-10.23.38-AM-768x432.png 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-10.23.38-AM-624x351.png 624w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-10.23.38-AM.png 1178w" width="512" height="288" /></figure>But archiving this material in ways that low literacy people can contribute, was another challenge they wanted to address. Dinesh and his team have created hypermedia archives, using image-based web annotation technology to connect audio to other audio. Like hypertext, where text documents are interconnected with other text documents through links, hypermedia does the same using media. The archive tool allows people to drag-and-drop images to associate them to audio files. 

Their hypermedia project has been underway for several years. What have they had to change since the COVID lockdowns? This year, Janastu was planning to go to another village and build out their mesh network, radio, and hypermedia archive in an area 2000km away. The pandemic forced them to indefinitely postpone that project. 

Now Dinesh and his team are building what he calls a “mesh mash” — a mesh network with an overlay or [logical network](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/14760/logical-network). Since building out the physical mesh network is difficult under the lockdown, they are enabling other devices, such as laptops or tablets connected through mobile cell service, to be part of the mesh.

They use IPv6 identifiers to allow those devices to connect and access the other nodes on the network. The mesh mash uses [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) to keep files synchronized and up-to-date across the mesh network. They use [Yggdrasil](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/) to configure log-ins and host video streamed workshops that are broadcast across the network. 

Dinesh is currently building out [Papad](https://gitlab.com/servelots/papad-api), the audio annotation tool. Like the hypermedia archives, the images can be dragged and dropped to related audio files. People can also add text tags to add another layer of annotation. For example, if an audio recording is about a math lesson, someone could find an image of numbers and arithmetic operators and add that to the audio file. This is all updated and available across the mesh network. 

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-04-at-5.48.29-PM-1024x583.png" class="wp-image-21175" width="1024" height="583" /></figure>This allows people to not only contribute their knowledge and stories to the mesh network. It empowers people to organize and archive this shared knowledge so it’s discoverable, all without needing to be able to read or write. This shared hypermedia archive enables people to connect across similar interests, share recipes, and even offer gig services across the villages.

Dinesh’s projects emerge out of a passion for creating technology that is community maintained and developed. He believes in the potential of technology, combined with locally-available resources and knowledge, to bring about local futures that are more equitable and self-determining.

Reflections
-----------

As COVID spread throughout the world, even those in the most internet-connected, developed cities were susceptible to misinformation, conspiracy theories, and fake news. Here in the United States, COVID has exposed deep deficiencies in how we access accurate, reliable information, especially about what we each must do to mitigate this crisis in our communities. 

The Global Fellows showed us how their communities are taking control of their network infrastructure, to make the information that is shared on their networks more relevant, accessible, and valuable for themselves. It’s easy to become disillusioned with the centralized, top-down, and profit-based systems that those of us in urban and developed areas have come to rely on for our news and information. Seeing how the Global Fellows are innovating to create homegrown technologies to address immediate information and education challenges is truly awe-inspiring. 

What they are showing us is that “decentralization” is not only a matter of developing technology that is not centrally managed. It’s about building community, meeting people where they are, and approaching technology not as an end unto itself, but a means to address the real challenges that people face.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jack-Dorsey-tweet.png" class="wp-image-19761" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jack-Dorsey-tweet.png 585w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jack-Dorsey-tweet-300x164.png 300w" width="585" height="319" /></figure>Dorsey went on to enumerate the current problems with social media: misinformation and abuse; opaque, proprietary algorithms that dictate what you see and hear; and financial incentives that elevate “controversy and outrage” rather than “conversation that informs and promotes health.”  But Twitter’s co-founder and CEO also sees promising new solutions:

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dorsey-final-tweet.png" class="wp-image-19762" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dorsey-final-tweet.png 590w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dorsey-final-tweet-300x77.png 300w" width="590" height="152" /></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DWeb-SF-Meet-Up-January-2020-copy.jpg" class="wp-image-19763" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DWeb-SF-Meet-Up-January-2020-copy.jpg 960w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DWeb-SF-Meet-Up-January-2020-copy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DWeb-SF-Meet-Up-January-2020-copy-768x432.jpg 768w" width="359" height="202" /></figure>

We agree. Much work *has* been done and some of the fundamentals are in place. So on January 21, 2020 the Internet Archive hosted “**Exploring Decentralized Social Media,**” a DWeb SF Meetup that attracted 120+ decentralized tech builders, founders, and those who just wanted to learn more. Decentralized social media app builders from London, Portland and San Francisco took us on a tour of where their projects are today.

The evening began with a survey of the decentralized social media landscape by researcher and [Happening.net](https://happening.net/) developer, [**Jay Graber**](https://twitter.com/arcalinea). (See her [two excellent Medium articles](https://medium.com/@jaygraber) on the subject.) Graber helped us understand the broad categories of what’s out there: federated protocols such as [**ActivityPub**](https://activitypub.rocks/) and Matrix; peer-to-peer protocols such as [**Scuttlebutt**](https://scuttlebutt.nz/), and social media apps that utilize blockchain in some way for  monetization, provenance or storage. What was clear from Graber’s talk was that she had tested and used dozens of tools, from [**Mastodon**](https://joinmastodon.org/) to [**Iris**](https://irislib.github.io/), [**Martti Malmi’s**](https://twitter.com/marttimalmi) new P-2-P social app and she deftly laid out the pros and cons of each.

What followed were talks by the founders and developers from each of Graber’s categories:

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Rabble-presentation.png" alt="Evan Henshaw-Plath (aka Rabble) was one of the earliest engineers at Twitter. He’s bringing years of startup experience to Planetary.social, his new P-2-P mobile version of Facebook." class="wp-image-19766" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Rabble-presentation.png 635w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Rabble-presentation-300x162.png 300w" width="427" height="231" /><figcaption>Evan Henshaw-Plath (aka Rabble) was one of the earliest engineers at Twitter. He’s bringing years of startup experience to Planetary.social, his new P-2-P mobile version of Facebook.</figcaption></figure>

[**Evan Henshaw-Plath**](https://twitter.com/rabble), an original Odeo/Twitter engineer, is the founder of [**Planetary.social**](https://planetary.social/), a P-2-P mobile app that’s “an open, humane Facebook alternative” built atop Scuttlebutt. His goal with Planetary is to make an app reflecting the values of the commons, but that feels as seamless and familiar as the social apps we already use.

Flying in from London, [**Matthew Hodgson**](https://twitter.com/ara4n), founder of [**Matrix.org**](https://matrix.org/), brought us up-to-date with his open network for fully encrypted, real-time communication. With an impressive 13.5 million account holders, including the governments of France and Germany, Matrix is showing hockey-stick-like growth. But Matrix’s greatest challenge: in an encrypted, decentralized system, how do you filter out the bad stuff? By using “decentralized reputation,” Hodgson explained, allowing users to moderate what they are willing to see. Hodgson also revealed he’s building an experimental P-2-P Matrix in 2020.

We are in the early days of integration." class="wp-image-19768" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/John-Ryan-Presentation.png 580w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/John-Ryan-Presentation-300x165.png 300w" width="425" height="234" /><figcaption>Today’s social media walled gardens are not that different from America’s phone companies in 1900, explained tech executive, John Ryan. We are in the early days of integration.</figcaption></figure>

Thought leader and tech executive, [**John Ryan**](https://twitter.com/johnconorryan), provided valuable historical context both onstage and in [his recent blog](https://medium.com/decentralized-web/decentralizing-ending-walled-gardens-6f0d4a8b4e98). He compared today’s social media platforms to telephone services in 1900. Back then, a Bell Telephone user couldn’t talk to an AT&T customer; businesses had to have multiple phone lines just to converse with their clients. It’s not that different today, Ryan asserts, when Facebook members can’t share their photos with Renren’s 150 million account holders. All of these walled gardens, he said, need a “trusted intermediary” layer to become fully interconnected.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Parag.png" alt="Twitter CTO, Parag Agrawal, has been tasked with bootstrapping a new team of decentralized builders called “Bluesky.”" class="wp-image-19775" width="240" height="261" /><figcaption>Twitter CTO, Parag Agrawal, has been tasked with bootstrapping a new team of decentralized builders called “Bluesky.”</figcaption></figure>

Next  **CTO,** [**Parag Agrawal**](https://twitter.com/paraga), outlined Twitter’s goals and the problems all social media platforms face. “Decentralization to us is not an end, it’s a means to an end,” he explained. “We have a hypothesis on how it can help solve these problems.” Agrawal says Twitter will be bootstrapping a team they call “[**bluesky**](https://twitter.com/bluesky),” who will not be Twitter employees, but independent. “Twitter will have very little control (over bluesky) other than our bootstrapping efforts,” he laid out.

  
Next up was [**Burak Nehbit**](https://twitter.com/nehbit), founder of [**Aether,**](https://getaether.net/pro/) something akin to a peer-to-peer Reddit. But here’s Aether’s secret sauce: expert moderation, with 100% transparency and communities who elect their own moderators. Aether is focused on “high quality conversations” and those users willing to roll up their sleeves and moderate them.

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Burak-Nehbit-Aether-1024x768.jpg" alt="Aether’s founder, Burak Nehbit, is creating a P-2-P social media platform of highly curated, self-governed content, where elected moderators ensure “high quality” conversations." class="wp-image-19771" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Burak-Nehbit-Aether-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Burak-Nehbit-Aether-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Burak-Nehbit-Aether-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Burak-Nehbit-Aether-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Burak-Nehbit-Aether-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" width="1024" height="768" /><figcaption>Aether’s founder, Burak Nehbit, is creating a P-2-P social media platform of highly curated, self-governed content, where elected moderators ensure “high quality” conversations.</figcaption></figure>And rounding out the evening was Edward West, founder of [**Hylo.com**](https://www.hylo.com/), an app that combines group management, messaging and collaboration built on [**holochain**](https://holochain.org/)**. ** Recently Holo acquired the Hylo software and Holo’s Director of Communications [**Jarod Holtz**](https://twitter.com/jarodholtz) explained why this union is significant for decentralized builders, including the **[Terran Collective](https://www.terran.io/)**‘s **Aaron Brodeur** and **[Clare Politano](https://twitter.com/clarebear8080)**, who will be stewarding the Hylo project: 

<figure><img src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Hylo-Holo-Terran-teams.png" alt="Edward West of Hylo, Aaron Brodeur, Jarod Holtz and Clare Politano are joining forces as Hylo.com is acquired by Holo and “stewarded” by the Terran Collective." class="wp-image-19772" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Hylo-Holo-Terran-teams.png 635w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Hylo-Holo-Terran-teams-300x174.png 300w" width="387" height="225" /><figcaption>Edward West of Hylo, Aaron Brodeur, Jarod Holtz and Clare Politano are joining forces as Hylo.com is acquired by Holo and “stewarded” by the Terran Collective.</figcaption></figure>

*From both a design and an engineering perspective, the way Hylo is structured makes it perfectly suited to being converted to run in the future as a decentralized application on Holochain. The Hylo code base will be instrumental in helping us demonstrate how a centralised app can be transformed into a distributed app.*  

Blockchain based social media solutions, including Bevan Barton’s [**Peepeth**](https://peepeth.com/welcome) built on Ethereum and Emre Sokullu of [**Pho Networks**](https://www.phonetworks.org/), gave overviews of their work at lightning speed. After the Meetup, Sokullu penned [**this article**](https://medium.com/@emresokullu/the-state-of-decentralized-social-networks-in-jan-2020-8d1c1708d69) explaining how Pho can serve as a programming language to build decentralized applications. 

From federated to blockchain and gradations in between, decentralized social media is taking flight.  And on one winter night in San Francisco, builders of wildly diverse projects came together at the Internet Archive to demonstrate how far they’ve come—and the long road ahead.
