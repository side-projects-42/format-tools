<p>Kanta Kapoor was the first in her family to go to a university. Growing up in New Delhi, she was determined to become an independent woman, and she knew education was the key to success.</p>
<p>“I understand the value of knowledge—to survive in this world, to make a living and make informed decisions,” said Kapoor, who excelled in school and worked at public and university libraries in India for several years before moving to Canada in 2012.</p>
<p>Kapoor developed an expertise in emerging technologies and became an advocate for open sharing of information. Now, she is manager of support services at the Milton Public Library (MPL) in Ontario. In that role, she helped MPL become an early adopter of the Internet Archive’s Open Libraries program, which offers digital access to the physical books that a library owns through the library practice known as controlled digital lending (CDL).</p>
<p>For her efforts to broaden access and embrace innovative practices, Kapoor has been named a recipient of the 2021 Internet Archive Hero Award. The annual award recognizes those who have exhibited leadership in making information available for digital learners all over the world. Past recipients have included <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/10/20/michelle-wu-receives-internet-archive-hero-award-for-establishing-the-legal-basis-for-controlled-digital-lending/">Michelle Wu</a>, <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/23/unlocking-the-potential-for-every-high-school-library-2019-internet-archive-hero-award/">Phillips Academy</a>, the <a href="https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2015/11/bhl-receives-internet-archives-internet.html">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a>, and the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/grateful-dead-win-internet-hero-award-for-viral-marketing/">Grateful Dead.</a></p>

<p>In her career, Kapoor has focused on leveraging technology to improve services to the community. She has a master’s degree in library science and gained a specialty in open-source software and data management through additional graduate studies at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>Kapoor said she was drawn to MPL in 2019 because the leadership team was forward thinking and there was an opportunity to expand community-led projects.</p>
<p>“We were challenged to think outside of the box and become champions throughout Canadian public libraries to stay ahead of the curve,” Kapoor said.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In my career, I’ve seen many changes—and it’s still evolving. We need to continue to adapt and embrace new technology.”</p>
<p>Kanta Kapoor, 2021 Internet Archive Hero Award recipient</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In her newly created position, she helped improve services for patrons and library staff alike with new technology, mobile apps and digitization of materials. When she was introduced to the Open Libraries program, Kapoor said she was impressed by the ability to provide millions of digitized books to users across the world. MPL decided this was the direction it wanted to go and became one of the first public libraries in Canada to embrace CDL and embed a link to Open Libraries in its catalogue.</p>
<p>MPL’s Mark Williams, chief librarian and chief executive officer, credits Kapoor’s strong leadership skills in building the partnership with the Internet Archive, which helped the MPL community during the earliest days of COVID-19 closures.</p>
<p>“It meant we were able to provide our patrons with access to tens of thousands of digitized materials at a time when they were more welcome than ever, during the pandemic lockdowns, while also being able to donate over 40,000 items for the benefit of a truly global audience,” he said. “We are incredibly fortunate that Kanta is part of the MPL team and her  compassion, graciousness, humility and ultimately exemplary leadership have been put to good use.”</p>

<p>MPL expanded its partnership by donating physical items to the Archive, obtained a state-of-the-art digitization scanner, and became involved with <a href="https://www.libraryfutures.net/">Library Futures</a>, a coalition of libraries and other stakeholders championing equitable access to knowledge.</p>
<p>Kapoor has helped promote materials available through CDL on the library’s web page, newsletters, and social media. So far, the response by users has been positive and Kapoor is reaching across her professional networks to educate her colleagues about the potential benefits.</p>
<p>“I encourage my fellow librarians to participate in this wonderful project to help their communities out,” Kapoor said. “In my career, I’ve seen many changes—and it’s still evolving. We need to continue to adapt and embrace new technology. I would like to see more libraries joining hands together to serve the community.”</p>

<p>As a child, Lisa Radha Weaver says she spent most Sunday afternoons at the Kitchener Public Library in Ontario. She has fond memories of the friendly library staff helping her load up as many books as she could carry home.</p>
<p>Then, as a college student at Trent and Queen’s Universities, Weaver again was struck by how kind and generous the people were behind the reference desk at the library. Finally, she asked: How do you get this job?</p>
<p>Weaver learned about the pathway to become a professional librarian. So, after finishing her undergraduate degree in education, she earned her master of library and information science at Western University in London, Ontario.</p>
<p>“I knew that I wanted to serve the public in the same way that I had always been served at all the libraries that I had the privilege of growing up with in the first half of my life,” said Weaver, now director of collections and program development at Hamilton Public Library (HPL) in Ontario.</p>
<p>But that public service role was tested in the spring of 2020 when HPL closed due to COVID-19, as she and her fellow library staff were left wondering how they were going to get books to members who were now locked out of their physical collection. Weaver had been instrumental in helping HPL become an early adopter of the Internet Archive’s Open Libraries program, which offers digital access to the physical books that a library owns. Because of the collections team’s hard work, HPL patrons had access to tens of thousands of books from the safety of their homes, and could continue to read and learn while the physical library remained closed.</p>

<p>In recognition of her contributions in her 20-plus year career, and her foresight in leading HPL into new digital lending practices, Weaver has been named the recipient of the 2021 Internet Archive Hero Award. The annual award recognizes those who have exhibited leadership in making information available for digital learners all over the world. Past recipients have included <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/10/20/michelle-wu-receives-internet-archive-hero-award-for-establishing-the-legal-basis-for-controlled-digital-lending/">Michelle Wu</a>, <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/23/unlocking-the-potential-for-every-high-school-library-2019-internet-archive-hero-award/">Phillips Academy</a>, the <a href="https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2015/11/bhl-receives-internet-archives-internet.html">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a>, and the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/grateful-dead-win-internet-hero-award-for-viral-marketing/">Grateful Dead</a>. </p>
<p>Weaver has long been committed to broadening access to information. Not everyone is as lucky as she was to have an adult bring them to the library, she says. Others don’t live nearby or work hours that limit their ability to physically visit a branch. To serve the changing needs of users, she has embraced digitizing collections and innovative outreach. </p>
<p>Weaver led efforts at HPL to become an early adopter of Controlled Digital Lending, as well as identify <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2021/05/26/behind-the-curtain-of-the-hamilton-public-library-theater-book-donation/">special collections to donate</a> to the Internet Archives for digitization.  </p>
<p>“CDL means removing barriers to access to collections in a way that is sustainable, accessible and equitable. With one library card, users have access to THE library, not just your local branch, system, region, province, state or even country,” Weaver said. “CDL means great breadth and depth in collections access. No one library can have all the books. CDL helps all libraries work together to best support each member to find what they are looking for, when and where they are looking for it.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I just really believe the library should be there for everyone, where they are and when they need it.”</p>
<p>Lisa Radha Weaver, 2021 Internet Archive Hero Award Recipient</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The timing of HPL’s embrace of CDL in the fall of 2019 was fortuitous. When the physical buildings had to close due to the pandemic in March 2020 for three months, the library was positioned to provide users with digital access to its collection through the Internet Archive.</p>
<p>“Our hearts were a little bit less heavy, knowing that at least that part of our collection continued to be accessible to people,” Weaver said. “We had positive feedback.”</p>
<p>HPL also beefed up its own virtual library collection and created a range of online programming. Weaver says it developed an online reference system so users could call, email or chat to get connected to the resources or collections, which was especially helpful to teachers and students. Staff also phoned older members of the library to just check in and some were thankful to learn about new ways to access the library online.</p>
<p>Weaver says her team at the library is fearless and collaborative in how they approach their work.</p>
<p>She credits support from her administration and green light from the library’s legal team with the success of the CDL at Hamilton. Management promotes the notion of a “freedom to fail card” to encourage risk-taking, which says she seized upon to embark on the practice. Also, the library got a legal option that it shared widely backing up the notion that it was well within the library’s right to participate. “Those two things really allowed us to step forward confidently with the Internet Archive in this project,” Weaver said.</p>

<p>Since 2019, Weaver has joined the call for wider acceptance of CDL. She has participated in several panel presentations with librarians to explain the details of CDL. She has also lobbied with others in Washington, D.C., making the case to lawmakers on Capitol Hill for policy that supports the practice. Weaver is known for her professionalism and thoughtfulness in promoting the benefit of CDL.</p>
<p>“The ‘c’ in CDL is controlled. One copy, one use,” Weaver said. “We already own these books. Why did we buy these books, if not, for the broader library community to access?  None of us are closing our libraries because we are running out of books, so doesn’t it make sense to share? Most people buy into that idea.”</p>
<p>Before joining HPL in 2018, Weaver was with the Toronto District School Board as manager of collections and extension services for 13 years. In that role, she coordinated operations with the largest library system in Canada and worked with diverse communities to expand digital access to learning materials for students. Weaver was honored by the Ontario School Library Association with the 2006 Mover and Shaker Award and the 2016 Award for Technical Service.</p>
<p>The motivation in all her work is simple: “I just really believe the library should be there for everyone, where they are and when they need it.”  </p>

<p>The kind of materials that Stanford English professor Margaret Cohen uses in her work, including the history of ocean travel in the period known as the “Age of Sail,” can be difficult to find.</p>

<p>Books and illustrations from the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries needed in her research and teaching are often tucked away in rare book collections. For about five years, Cohen has been turning to the Internet Archive for help. And that access was even more critical during the pandemic when physical libraries were closed.</p>
<p>“It’s really enriched the arguments I can make about cultural history,” Cohen said. “The availability of documents and the very intensive work of tracking these down has become so much easier. The Internet Archive is a very user-friendly tool.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/details/biodiversity">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a> has been a resource to Cohen in teaching her English class, Imagining the Ocean.

<p>“Access to the history of science is useful to me. I’m a literature professor, but the imagination spans across different areas,” said Cohen, the Andrew B. Hammond Professor of French Language, Literature, and Civilization and Director, Center for the Study of the Novel.</p>
<p>In her own research of oceanic studies, Cohen explores the importance of diversity and reality in marine environments. She tapped into the Internet Archive to fact-check information for <em><a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/cultural-history-of-the-sea-9781474299107">A Cultural History of the Sea</a></em>, (Bloomsbury, April 2021), a six-volume series that she edited chronicling the vital role oceans have played over time.</p>
<p>In researching her upcoming book, <em>The Underwater Eye: How the Movie Camera Opened the Depths and Unleashed New Realms of Fantasy</em> to be published by Princeton University Press, Cohen said the Wayback Machine was critical in confirming sources on websites that were no longer live.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/details/SciFi_Horror">Sci-Fi/Horror collection</a> of the Internet Archive has been useful to Cohen in teaching a course on Gothic film—especially since YouTube recently took down many of its films in that genre, she said.</p>
<p>Much of the material Cohen is looking for is in the public domain (such as <a href="https://archive.org/details/pub_punch"><em>Punch</em></a>, a satirical British magazine that dates back to the mid-1800s ) but the documents are fragile because of their age. She has also  appreciated being able to borrow classic books of literary criticism, such as the collection on novel studies that supports her graduate course, Genres of the Novel. </p>
<p> “People’s time is limited and having access to this material facilitates scholarship,” Cohen said of the benefits of digitized documents. “I understand why publishers need to make money and I publish myself, but free access to information, particularly for nonprofit use, is a gift.”</p>

<p>Although Casey Patterson spent much of the COVID-19 lockdown in a dank San Francisco basement apartment, he says he felt lucky in many ways.</p>
<p>The graduate student in English from Stanford University stayed healthy and—despite not having physical access to a library—was able to research his dissertation, teach classes, and prepare for job interviews. This was possible because of online access to materials through the Internet Archive.</p>

<p>Patterson, who is entering the sixth year of his doctoral program, offered to teach an online African American literature class to undergraduates as soon as COVID-19 shut down the campus and the university shifted to virtual instruction.</p>
<p>“I just felt a degree of duty to sign up for a lot of teaching. I wanted to be able to support students and knew the transition to online education was going to be rocky,” said Patterson, who also taught an Intro to Black Studies course during the pandemic. “It was chaotic. Obviously, we had a really tough time trying to figure out how to keep students engaged and make education a humane process.”</p>
<p>Instead of expecting students to buy several books, and without the ability for them to check out books in a library, Patterson turned to the Internet Archive. Patterson found works of Black critics such as Toni Morrison and C.L.R. James and their writings about 19<sup>th</sup> century authors Edgar Allen Poe and Herman Melville to use in class. He downloaded classics including <a href="https://archive.org/details/mobydick00melv_1">Moby Dick</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/adventuresofhuck00twai">Huckleberry Finn</a> to the Canvas learning management system and made them immediately available to students.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Using the Internet Archive, I could lay hands on basically everything I needed. It was an absolutely indispensable resource at the time.”</p>
<p>Casey Patterson, graduate student</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“It’s super helpful when you’re asking students to read 10 short passages from three different novels,” Patterson said of using the Internet Archive. “It would be cruel to ask them to buy all of the books or track them down to the library. This way you put them right at the students’ fingertips.”</p>
<p>Patterson also relied on text from the Internet Archive for his own research. For his dissertation, he is examining the role of educational history as a way of understanding African American literary studies and the institutionalization of Black studies as a discipline.</p>
<p>This spring, he interviewed for an academic job in which he was asked to prepare a lesson plan syllabus for a teaching demonstration. Having access to <a href="https://archive.org/details/bookofamericanne01john">The Book of American Negro Poetry</a>, works of African-American poet <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Wheatley%2C+Phillis%2C+1753-1784%22">Phillis Wheatley</a>, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/insearchofourmot0000walk">essays by Alice Walker</a> enabled Patterson to put together materials from the convenience of his apartment on a tight deadline.</p>

<p>“Using the Internet Archive, I could lay hands on basically everything I needed,” Patterson said. “It was an absolutely indispensable resource at the time,” he says.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2019, Patterson had used the Internet Archive in his Fandom research, another area of interest. He’d run across a citation to a website that was no longer available online and was able to track it down through the Wayback Machine. But since the pandemic, Patterson says he’s come to value the Internet Archive for its collection of primary sources.</p>
<p>“Knowledge is for everybody. The more we can do to break down the barriers that make it inaccessible, the better off everyone is,” said Patterson. “The Internet Archive is one great example of how we can do that almost with a click of a button.”</p>

<p>Motivating students to stay engaged with online instruction can take some creativity.</p>
<p>Working at a special education learning center in Los Angeles, Luca Messarra found the promise of choosing a book to read for fun after a lesson kept his 9- to 11-year-old kids going. Although access to physical books was limited during the pandemic, he found digital versions in the Internet Archive that made all the difference.</p>

<p>Messarra’s individual work with students moved online in March 2020, in the early days of the pandemic. He continued to help them learn to read and write by doing drills remotely, using online instruction materials provided by the learning center. It did not have access to digital works of fiction, but Messarra says those were the books that most excited the students.</p>
<p>“That was the most fun because it was an opportunity for them to see the fruits of their labor. They could read a book, finally,” says the 25-year-old who lives in Palo Alto. “It’s far more entertaining to read a book than to do drills over and over again. That was the highlight for a lot of students—to finally be able to read a book of their own choosing.”</p>
<p>Since wrapping up his job at the learning center, Messarra has been enrolled in a graduate English program at Stanford University where he is specializing in digital humanities and postcolonialism.</p>
<p>Looking back on his teaching experience during the pandemic, Messarra says he values the resources from the Internet Archive. “It was incredibly helpful and quite essential to boost the morale of students. They were bored and frustrated because of the pandemic,” he says. “For one of my students, it was his goal to read Harry Potter. Once he was able to read it, he was super excited and eventually bought the book because he was having such a good time.”</p>

<p>During the pandemic, perhaps you have been cleaning out some bookshelves in your house. Or maybe you are a librarian, planning to be back in your building for the first time in more than a year and restarting collection management activities.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what to do with your excess materials, the Internet Archive can help. The nonprofit library accepts donation books, records (CDs, LPs, 45rpm, 78rpm, cylinders), films, and microforms that it does not already have in its collection. The Archive preserves one copy of everything it receives and tries to find good homes for duplicates. Then, as funding allows, the Archive digitizes the materials and helps them reach a wider audience online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No donation is too far away or small to be considered by the Internet Archive.”</p>
<p>Liz Rosenberg, donations manager, Internet Archive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a <a href="https://archive.org/details/physical-donations-webinar">recent webinar</a>, staff from the Archive explained the process for donating and  encouraged the public’s help as it works to provide universal access to everything ever published.</p>
<p>“No donation is too far away or small to be considered by the Internet Archive,” said Liz Rosenberg, donations manager. She has helped coordinate donations of entire libraries, including collections from <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/10/20/digitization-saves-marygrove-college-library-after-closure/">Marygrove College</a> in Detroit and <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2021/01/27/bay-state-college-flips-to-digital-by-donating-entire-college-library-to-the-internet-archive/">Bay State College’s Boston Campus</a>.</p>
<h2 id="donation-process">Donation Process</h2>
<p>To find out more about what’s involved with physical donations, Rosenberg suggests going to the <a href="https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360017876312-How-do-I-make-a-physical-donation-to-the-Internet-Archive-">Help page</a> for details about shipping instructions or dropping off donations smaller than about 20 boxes. All others are asked to complete a physical item <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPYFFO_-85RZOsULfG2luvt5TetI66OtChJL0xOLqujBlJjg/viewform">donation form</a> to provide all the information to make a larger donation happen, including where the items are located, an accurate count, and other special considerations for the offer.</p>

<p>Once submitted, staff begin the planning process to determine if the collection is in a format that can be accepted, if there are duplicates, and the project timeline. Arrangements then can be made for packing and shipping. In the case of larger collections, the Archive typically is able to provide assistance with transportation costs.</p>
<p>Sometimes donors pack their own items and then the Archive pays for the shipping. That was the case for a recent donation of 18,000 records from a music enthusiast in Washington D.C. The donor was looking for a “forever home” for his beloved vinyl and the Archive was happy to schedule a pickup and preserve the rare collection, Rosenberg said.</p>
<h2 id="why-donate">Why Donate?</h2>
<p>For donations of 50 or more items, the Archive can create a collection to both honor the donor and make their donation accessible all in one place. “The ability to access all of their media in one place really reassures our donors that they will still have access to their items even once they’re no longer in their physical possession,” said Rosenberg. Some stories behind major contributions are covered by the Archive in its <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/11/13/the-rutgers-university-poster-project/">blog</a>.</p>

It receives many of its books from library partners around the world. The Archive accepts many materials that BWB will not.</p>

<p>“We love more than anything to get large collections—entire intellectual units, such as a reference collection that is curated,” said Chris Freeland, a librarian who works at the Archive. “It helps us round out our collection, and helps our patrons. If someone has a collection that no longer fits their collection development priorities, think of Better World Book or the Internet Archive for those materials.”</p>
<p>The Archive is open to over-sized items, such as maps, and books that do not have to have an ISBN number. What about loose periodicals? The Archive does not want a few scattered issues but does have interest in long runs of a magazine.</p>
<p>Once digitized, <a href="https://archive.org/details/printdisabled?tab=about">patrons with print disabilities</a> can access the materials and some are selected to be accessible via Controlled Digital Lending and for machine learning research. Together, we can achieve long term preservation and access to our collective cultural legacy.</p>

<p>Libraries have historically been trusted hubs to equalize access to credible information, a crucial role that they should continue to fill in the digital age. However, as more information is born-digital, digitized, or digital-first, libraries must build new policy, legal and public understandings about how advances in technology impact our preservation, community, and collection development practices.</p>
<p>This panel will bring together legal scholars Ariel Katz (University of Toronto) and Argyri Panezi (IE University Madrid/Stanford University) to discuss their work on library digital exhaustion and public service roles for digital libraries. They will be joined by Lisa Radha Weaver, Director of Collections and Program Development at Hamilton Public Library, who will discuss how library services have been transformed by digital delivery and innovation and Kyle Courtney of Library Futures/Harvard University, a lawyer/librarian who wrote the influential Statement on Controlled Digital Lending, signed by over 50 institutions. The panel will be moderated by Lila Bailey of Internet Archive.</p>

<p><em>Guest post by author Fran Moreland Johns.</em></p>
<p>Whenever I’ve had a book published I have celebrated every sale. But the biggest cause for celebration – the sale that always made me most proud – was when a library acquired a copy or two. Individuals may purchase a book, shelve it or pass it along to a friend, and thereafter it disappears. Libraries are forever.</p>

<p>This is the belief that underscores my enthusiasm for the Internet Archive. While the Atlanta Public Library may one day cull my book to make room for someone else’s, those words I labored over and so treasure, whether anyone else ever treasures them or not, are safe with the Internet Archive. And may it thrive and prosper.</p>

<p>This is all a very long way from my literary beginnings on a Royal portable typewriter. I wrote for newspapers and magazines – the <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch, USA Today, National Real Estate Investor</em> to cite just a few of the wildly different multiple dozens – from the early 1950s into the technologically bewildering 2020s. Eventually I added an MFA in short fiction to my BA in Art and veered into short stories, with a few tiny publication successes, including <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/dyingunafraid0000john">Dying unafraid</a></em> (1999) and <em>Perilous Times: An inside look at abortion before – and after – Roe v Wade</em> (2013). When the internet came along, I tiptoed in via a blog for news aggregate site True/Slant.com which eventually morphed into today’s <a href="https://franjohns.net/">franjohns.net</a>. With a little luck my short story collection, <em>Marshallville Stories</em>, will be published in 2022; the Internet Archive will get one of the first copies.</p>
<p>I’ve been following the <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/publishers-are-taking-the-internet-to-court/">conflict between U.S. publishers and the Internet Archive</a> with some degree of horror and dismay. Publishers, I realize, are in business to make money and thereby stay in business. Do they not want people, as many people as possible, to read the books they publish? After the first flurry of sales (perhaps excluding the blockbuster books that will make big bucks for authors and publishers alike, may they also thrive and prosper) does it not follow that publishers would want their books to enjoy long and successful lives? That, at least, is the hope I believe most authors harbor. I can’t claim to speak for other authors, but this I know is personally true: I write for the joy of writing, and in the hope of being read. I’d be surprised if there were many writers out there who don’t feel the same.</p>
<p>So let’s hear it for libraries. And for the one that’s unique among all others, the Internet Archive.</p>

<p>For the second event in a summer series about the innovative library practice of Controlled Digital Lending, we’ll hear from libraries, consortia, and librarians who are exploring CDL implementations at their institutions and communities with hands on learning around potential and existing solutions. Learn about building institutional CDL policies, user experience for patrons and staff, technological platforms, and how you can get involved with the CDL community. Bring your questions, ideas, and be prepared to dig in!</p>
<p>Co-hosted by Library Futures, Internet Archive, Project Reshare, Open Library Foundation, and CDL Implementers</p>
