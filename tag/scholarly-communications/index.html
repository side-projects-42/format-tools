<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to archive and provide perpetual access to at-risk, open-access scholarship, we have released Refcat (“reference” + “catalog”), the citation index culled from the catalog that underpins our <a href="https://scholar.archive.org/">IA Scholar</a> service for discovering the scholarly literature and research outputs within Internet Archive. This first release of the Refcat dataset contains over 1.3 billion citations extracted from over 60 million metadata records and over 120 million scholarly artifacts (articles, books, datasets, proceedings, code, etc) that IA Scholar has archived through web harvesting, digitization, integrations with other open knowledge services, and through partnerships and joint initiatives.</p>
<p>Refcat represents one of the larger citation graph datasets of scholarly literature, as well as uniquely containing a notable portion of citations from works that do not have a DOI or persistent identifier. We hope this dataset will be a valuable community resource alongside other critical knowledge graph projects, including those with which we are collaborating, such as <a href="https://opencitations.net/">OpenCitations</a> and <a href="http://wikicite.org/">Wikicite</a>. </p>
<p>The Refcat dataset is released under a CC0 license and is <a href="https://archive.org/details/refcat_2021-07-28">available for download from archive.org</a>. The related software created for the extraction and matching process, including exact and fuzzy citation matching (<a href="https://gitlab.com/internetarchive/refcat">refcat</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/internetarchive/fuzzycat/">fuzzycat</a>), are also released as open-source tools. For those interested in technical details about the project, a white paper is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06595">available on arxiv.org</a> authored by IA engineers, including Martin Czygan, who led work on Refcat, and is described in <a href="https://guide.fatcat.wiki/reference_graph.html">our catalog user guide</a>.</p>
<p>What does Refcat mean for regular users of IA Scholar? Refcat results from work to ensure the interconnection between material within IA Scholar and other resources archived in Internet Archive in order to make browsing and lookups easier and to ensure overall citation integrity and persistence. For example, there are over 25 million web links in the citations in Refcat and we were able to match ~14 million of these to archived web pages in <a href="http://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> and also found that ~18% of these matched web citations are no longer available on the live web. Web links in citations not in Wayback Machine have been added to ongoing web harvests. We also matched over 20 million citations to books that are available for lending in our <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> service and matched over 1 million citations to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> entries. </p>
<p>Besides interconnection, Refcat will allow users to understand what works have cited a specific scholarly resource (i.e. “cited by” or “inbound citations”) that will help with improved discovery features. Finally, knowing the full “knowledge graph” of IA Scholar helps us better identify important scholarly material that we have not yet archived, thus improving the overall quality and extent of the collection. This, in turn, aids scholars by ensuring their open-access work is archived and accessible forever, especially for those whose publisher may not have the resources for long-term preservation, and it ensures that related outputs like research registrations or datasets are also archived, matched to the article of record, and available into the future.</p>
<p>The Refcat release is a milestone of Phase Two of our project, “Ensuring the Persistent Access of Long Tail Open Access Journal Literature,” <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2018/03/05/andrew-w-mellon-foundation-awards-grant-to-the-internet-archive-for-long-tail-journal-preservation/">first announced in 2018</a> and supported by funding from the <a href="https://mellon.org/grants/grants-database/grants/internet-archive/1910-07256/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>. Current work focuses on citation integrity within the IA Scholar archive, partnerships and services, such as our role in the multi-institutional <a href="https://doaj.org/preservation/">Project Jasper</a> and our partnership with <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2019/09/24/internet-archive-and-center-for-open-science-collaborate-to-preserve-open-science-data/">Center for Open Science</a>, and the addition of secondary scholarly outputs to IA Scholar, including datasets, software, and other non-article/book scholarly materials. Lookout for a plethora of announcements about other IA Scholar milestones in the coming months!</p>

<p><em>Since 2017, Internet Archive has pursued dedicated technical and partnership work to help preserve and provide perpetual access to open access scholarly literature and other outputs. See our <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2018/03/05/andrew-w-mellon-foundation-awards-grant-to-the-internet-archive-for-long-tail-journal-preservation/">original announcement</a> related to this work and a recent <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/09/15/how-the-internet-archive-is-ensuring-permanent-access-to-open-access-journal-articles/">update on progress</a>. The below official press release announces an exciting new multi-institutional collaboration in this area.</em></p>
<p>The Directory of Open Access Journals (<a href="https://doaj.org">DOAJ</a>), the <a href="https://clockss.org/">CLOCKSS Archive</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, <a href="https://keepers.issn.org/">Keepers Registry</a>/ISSN International Centre and <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/">Public Knowledge Project</a> (PKP) have agreed to partner to provide an alternative pathway for the preservation of small-scale, APC-free, Open Access journals.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11933">The recent study</a> authored by M.Laakso, L.Matthias, and N.Jahn has revived academia’s concern over the disappearance of the scholarly record disseminated in Open Access (OA) journals.</p>
<p>Their research focuses on OA journals as at risk of vanishing, and “especially small-scale and APC-free journals […] with limited financial resources” that often “opt for lightweight technical solutions” and “cannot afford to enroll in preservation schemes.” The authors have used data available in the Directory of Open Access Journals to come up with the conclusion that just under half of the journals indexed in DOAJ participate in preservation schemes. Their findings “suggest that current approaches to digital preservation are successful in archiving content from larger journals and established publishing houses but leave behind those that are more at risk.” They call for new preservation initiatives “to develop alternative pathways […] better suited for smaller journals that operate without the support of large, professional publishers.”</p>
<p>Answering that call, the joint initiative proposed by the five organisations aims at offering an affordable archiving option to OA journals with no author fees (“diamond” OA) registered with DOAJ, as well as raising awareness among the editors and publishers of these journals about the importance of enrolling with a preservation solution. DOAJ will act as a single interface with CLOCKSS, PKP and Internet Archive and facilitate a connection to these services for interested journals. Lars Bjørnhauge, DOAJ Managing Editor, said: “That this group of organisations are coming together to find a solution to the problem of “vanishing” journals is exciting. It comes as no surprise that journals with little to no funding are prone to disappearing. I am confident that we can make a real difference here.”</p>
<p>Reports regarding the effective preservation of the journals’ content will be aggregated by the ISSN International Centre (ISSN IC) and published in the Keepers Registry. Gaëlle Béquet, ISSN IC Director, commented: “As the operator of the Keepers Registry service, the ISSN International Centre receives inquiries from journal publishers looking for archiving solutions. This project is a new step in the development of our service to meet this need in a transparent and diverse way involving all our partners.”</p>
<p>About 50% of the journals identified by DOAJ as having no archiving solution in place use the Open Journal System (OJS). Therefore, the initiative will also identify and encourage journals on PKP’s OJS platform to preserve their content in the PKP Preservation Network (PKP PN), or to use another supported solution if the OJS instance isn’t new enough to be compatible with the PN integration (OJS 3.1.2+). </p>
<p>The partners will then follow up by assessing the success and viability of the initiative with an aim to open it up to new archiving agencies and other groups of journals indexed in DOAJ to consolidate preservation actions and ensure service diversity.</p>
<p>DOAJ will act as the central hub where publishers will indicate that they want to participate. Archiving services, provided by CLOCKSS, Internet Archive and PKP will expand their existing capacities. These agencies will report their metadata to the Keepers Registry to provide an overview of the archiving efforts. </p>
<p>Project partners are currently exploring business and financial sustainability models and outlining areas for technical collaboration.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://doaj.org/">DOAJ</a> is a community-curated list of peer-reviewed, open access journals and aims to be the starting point for all information searches for quality, peer reviewed open access material. DOAJ’s mission is to increase the visibility, accessibility, reputation, usage and impact of quality, peer-reviewed, open access scholarly research journals globally, regardless of discipline, geography or language. DOAJ will work with editors, publishers and journal owners to help them understand the value of best practice publishing and standards and apply those to their own operations. DOAJ is committed to being 100% independent and maintaining all of its services and metadata as free to use or reuse for everyone.</p>
<p>CLOCKSS is a not-for-profit joint venture among the world’s leading academic publishers and research libraries whose mission is to build a sustainable, international, and geographically distributed dark archive with which to ensure the long-term survival of Web-based scholarly publications for the benefit of the greater global research community. <a href="https://www.clockss.org" class="uri">https://www.clockss.org</a>.</p>
<p>Internet Archive is a non-profit digital library, top 200 website at <a href="https://archive.org/" class="uri">https://archive.org/</a>, and archive of over 60PB of millions of free books, movies, software, music, websites, and more. The Internet Archive partners with over 800 libraries, universities, governments, non-profits, scholarly communications, and open knowledge organizations around the world to advance the shared goal of “Universal Access to All Knowledge.” Since 2017, Internet Archive has pursued partnerships and technical work with a focus on preserving all publicly accessible research outputs, especially at-risk, open access journal literature and data, and providing mission-aligned, non-commercial open infrastructure for the preservation of scholarly knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="https://keepers.issn.org/">Keepers Registry</a> hosted by the ISSN International Centre, an intergovernmental organisation under the auspices of UNESCO, is a global service that monitors the archiving arrangements for continuing resources including e-serials. A dozen archiving agencies all around the world currently report to Keepers Registry. The Registry has three main purposes: 1/ to enable librarians, publishers and policy makers to find out who is looking after what e-content, how, and with what terms of access; 2/ to highlight e-journals which are still “at risk of loss” and need to be archived; 3/ to showcase the archiving organizations around the world, i.e. the Keepers, which provide the digital shelves for access to content over the long term.</p>
<p><a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/">PKP</a> is a multi-university and long-standing research project that develops (free) open source software to improve the quality and reach of scholarly publishing. For more than twenty years, PKP has played an important role in championing open access. Open Journal Systems (OJS) was released in 2002 to help reduce cost as a barrier to creating and consuming scholarship online. Today, it is the world’s most widely used open source platform for journal publishing: approximately 42% of the journals in the DOAJ identify OJS as their platform/host/aggregator. In 2014, PKP launched its own Private LOCKSS Network (now the PKP PN) to offer OJS journals unable to invest in digital preservation a free, open, and trustworthy service. </p>

<p>Posted on <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/09/15/how-the-internet-archive-is-ensuring-permanent-access-to-open-access-journal-articles/" title="5:35 pm">September 15, 2020</a><span class="by-author"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/author/bnewbold/" class="url fn n" title="View all posts by bnewbold">bnewbold</a></span></span></p>
<p><em>Internet Archive has archived and identified 9 million open access journal articles– the next 5 million is getting harder</em></p>
<p>Open Access journals, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190520161038/http:/newtheologyreview.org:80/index.php/ntr/issue/archive">New Theology Review</a> (ISSN: 0896-4297) and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190621023739/http://rossscience.org/ojhmt/index.php">Open Journal of Hematology</a> (ISSN: 2075-907X), made their research articles available for free online for years. With a quick click or a simple query, students anywhere in the world could access their articles, and diligent Wikipedia editors could verify facts against original articles on vitamin deficiency and blood donation.  </p>
<p>But some journals, such as these titles, are no longer available from the publisher’s websites, and are only available through the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Since 2017, the Internet Archive joined others in concentrating on archiving all scholarly literature and making it permanently accessible.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web has made it easier than ever for scholars to collaborate, debate, and share their research. Unfortunately, the structure of today’s web means that content can disappear just as easily: as of today the official publisher websites and DOI redirects for both of the above journals go nowhere or have been replaced with unrelated content.</p>

<p>Vigilant librarians saw this problem coming decades ago, when the print-to-digital migration was getting started. They insisted that commercial publishers work with contract digital preservation organizations (such as Portico, LOCKSS, and CLOCKSS) to ensure long-term access to expensive journal subscription content. Efforts have been made to preserve open articles as well, such as Public Knowledge Project’s <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-pn/">Private LOCKSS Network</a> for OJS journals and national hosting platforms like the <a href="https://www.scielo.br/">SciELO</a> network. But a portion of all scholarly articles continues to fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>Researchers found that 176 open access journals have already vanished from their publishers’ website over the past two decades, according to a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11933">preprint article</a> by Mikael Laakso, Lisa Matthias, and Najko Jahn. These periodicals were from all regions of the world and represented all major disciplines — sciences, humanities and social sciences. There are over 14,000 open access journals indexed by the <a href="https://doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> and the paper suggests another 900 of those are inactive and at risk of disappearing. The pre-print has struck a nerve, receiving news coverage in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-02610-z">Nature</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abe6998">Science</a>.</p>
<p>In 2017, with <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2018/03/05/andrew-w-mellon-foundation-awards-grant-to-the-internet-archive-for-long-tail-journal-preservation/">funding support from the Andrew Mellon Foundation</a> and the Kahle/Austin Foundation, the Internet Archive launched a project focused on preserving all publicly accessible research documents, with a particular focus on open access materials. Our first job was to quantify the scale of the problem.</p>

<p>Of the 14.8 million known open access articles published since 1996, the Internet Archive has archived, identified, and made available through the Wayback Machine 9.1 million of them (“bright” green in the chart above). In the jargon of Open Access, we are counting only “gold” and “hybrid” articles which we expect to be available directly from the publisher, as opposed to preprints, such as in <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arxiv.org</a> or institutional repositories. Another 3.2 million are believed to be preserved by one or more contracted preservation organizations, based on records kept by <a href="https://keepers.issn.org/stats">Keepers Registry</a> (“dark” olive in the chart). These copies are not intended to be accessible to anybody unless the publisher becomes inaccessible, in which case they are “triggered” and become accessible.</p>
<p>This leaves at least 2.4 million Open Access articles at risk of vanishing from the web (“None”, red in the chart). While many of these are still on publisher’s websites, these have proven difficult to archive.</p>
<p>One of our goals is to archive as many of the articles on the open web as we can, and to keep up with the growing stream of new articles published every day. Another is to look back over the vast petabytes of web content in the Wayback Machine, back to 1996, and find any content we might already have but is not easily findable or discoverable. Both of these projects are amenable to software automation, but made more difficult by the evolving nature of HTML and PDFs and their diverse character sets and encodings. To that end, we have approached this project not just as a technical one, but also as a collaborative one that aims to add another piece to the distributed infrastructure supporting open scholarship.</p>
<p>To expand our reach, we built an editable catalog (<a href="https://fatcat.wiki" class="uri">https://fatcat.wiki</a>) with an open API to allow anybody to contribute. As the software is free and open source, as is the data, we invite others to reuse and link to the content we have archived. We have also <a href="https://scholar-qa.archive.org/">indexed and made searchable</a> much of the literature to help manage our work and help others find if we have archived particular articles. We want to make scholarly material permanently available, and available in new ways– including via large datasets for analysis and “meta research.” </p>
<p>We also want to acknowledge the many partnerships and collaborations that have supported this work, many of which are key parts of the open scholarly infrastructure, including ISSN, DOAJ, LOCKSS, Unpaywall, Semantic Scholar, CiteSeerX, Crossref, Datacite, and many others. We also want to acknowledge the many Internet Archive staff and volunteers that have contributed to this work, including Bryan Newbold, Martin Czygan, Paul Baclace, Jefferson Bailey, Kenji Nagahashi, David Rosenthal, Victoria Reich, Ellen Spertus, and others.</p>
